      "t1": "Read and Select Question UI",
      "a2": "First, let’s introduce this question format. “Read and Select”, also known as “Word Recognition”, primarily assesses the test taker’s familiarity with word spelling. The format is straightforward – during the test, you will need to determine whether the word displayed on the screen is spelled correctly and click the corresponding button to indicate if it is correct or not. This question type appears 15 to 18 times in the actual test. Each time, a word will be shown in the center of the screen, and you will have only 5 seconds to make a judgment.",
      "t2": "Read and Select Questions: Intro and Tips",
      "a3": "Therefore, a good command of word spelling and quick reaction and judgment skills are essential. When answering these questions, carefully read the spelling of each word, as incorrect words often have spellings similar to correct ones, making it easy to select the wrong option if you’re not attentive. ",
      "a3_1": "Additionally, learning word formation rules, understanding common roots, prefixes, and suffixes, and their meanings can help you make better judgments when necessary. Of course, mastering some spelling rules can also be helpful. For example, in an unstressed closed syllable, when the letters “i” and “e” are together, “i” usually comes before “e”, unless they are preceded by the letter “c”, such as in words like “believe”, “field”, and “niece”.",
      "a3_2": "Ultimately, to fundamentally improve your accuracy in this question type, you need to memorize more words and expand your vocabulary. Moreover, practicing with the questions in the question bank can help you quickly adapt to the pace of this type of question, understand common incorrect word settings, and improve your accuracy.",

      "a4": "Next, let’s discuss some knowledge of word formation and familiarize ourselves with the concepts of roots and affixes. What is a word root? A word root is the core part of a word and usually carries the basic meaning of the word. Most roots originate from ancient Greek and Latin. For example, “struct” in “construction”, “instruct”, and “destruction” means “to build” or “structure”, while “port” in “transport” and “portable” means “to carry” or “transport”. Then there are affixes, which are letters or combinations of letters added before or after the root to modify the meaning of the root or create a new word.",
      "a4_1": "Depending on their position in the word, affixes can be further divided into prefixes and suffixes. Prefixes are affixes added before the root. For example, “un-” in “undo” or “unhappy” indicates negation. Suffixes are affixes added after the root. For example, “-able” in “readable” or “likable” means “able to be” or “having the quality of”.",
      "t4": "Word Roots VS Affixes: Differences",
      "a5": "Now, let’s look at the differences between roots and affixes. First, in terms of meaning and function, roots usually provide the main meaning of the word, while affixes modify or change that meaning. For example, in the word “inspect”, “in-” is a prefix. In “inspect”, “in-” means “into”, implying the meaning of looking deeply or examining.",
      "a5_1": "The rest of the word, “-spect”, comes from a Latin root meaning “to look” or “to observe”. Therefore, “inspect” as a whole can be understood as “to go in and observe or examine”. Additionally, in terms of independence, most roots can exist independently as complete words, while affixes cannot exist independently and must be attached to roots to have meaning.",
      "a5_2": "Let’s illustrate with an example. The suffix “-ness” cannot be used alone; it is used to convert adjectives into nouns. For example, in the word “happiness”, “-ness” is attached to “happy”, converting the adjective into a noun. Finally, let’s look at the position of roots and affixes in words. The root is the central part of the word, while affixes are placed before or after the root.",
      "a5_3": "For example, in the word “disagreement”, the two affixes “dis-” and “-ment” are located at the beginning and end of the word, respectively, as the prefix and suffix. Just like in the image below, the red parts can be understood as the prefixes and suffixes of the word, while the blue part in the middle can be understood as the root of the word.",
      "t5": "",
      "a6_h2": "Common Error Patterns",
      "a6": "Let’s look at some common error patterns. First, there are similar words, where common errors include letter substitution, letter addition, and letter omission in correct words. Therefore, before making a selection, we need to carefully read and spell the selected word to see if it is completely correct and whether there are any added, omitted, or substituted letters.",
      "t6": "Common Patterns of Frequently Misspelled Words Example 1: slush",
      "a7": "Let’s look at the following examples. You can determine if it is a correct word. Do you think “snush” is a word? In fact, the correct word is “slush”, so the letter “n” here has been replaced with “l”, resulting in a letter substitution error, making it an incorrect word.",
      "t7": "Common Patterns of Frequently Misspelled Words Example 2: carriage",
      "a8": "Let’s look at the next one. Is “curriage” a word? The correct word should be “carriage”. Here, there is also a letter substitution error, where the second letter of the correct word has been replaced with an incorrect one, so this word is also incorrect.",
      "t8": "Common Patterns of Frequently Misspelled Words Example 3: bunny",
      "a9": "Look at this word, “buny”. Is it correct? The correct word here should be “bunny”. There is a letter omission error, missing the letter “n”, so it is also an incorrect word.",
      "t9": "Common Patterns of Frequently Misspelled Words Example 4: man",
      "a10": "Let’s look at the word “myan”. The correct word here should be “man”, but the word has an extra letter “y”, so it is incorrect.",
      "t10": "Common Patterns of Frequently Misspelled Words Example 5: guide",
      "a11": "Let’s look at cases of letter addition. For example, the word “guidet”. You can see that the correct word is actually “guide”. This word has an extra letter “t” added at the end, resulting in an error.",
      "t11": "Common Patterns of Frequently Misspelled Words Example 6: intend",
      "a12": "Another example is the word “intendle”. Here, the letters “l” and “e” have been added after “intend”, so it is also incorrect.",
      "a12_1": "Let’s now look at cases of word form errors. Before making a selection, we need to carefully consider whether the combination of roots and affixes is correct, whether there are incorrect combinations, and whether there are combinations of multiple correct words. Additionally, before making a selection, we need to carefully consider whether the word form changes follow the rules.",
      "t12": "Common Patterns of Frequently Misspelled Words Example 7: informal",
      "a13": "Let’s look at the following examples: For the word “unformal”, do you think it is correct? In fact, the correct word should be “informal”. Here, the prefix of the word is incorrect.",

      "a14": "Let’s look at the word “warnning”. It seems to be correct, but please note that we do not need to double the letter “n”, so the correct word form should be “warning”, with only one letter “n”, not two.",

      "a15": "Let’s look at the word “southout”. I believe you have already guessed that although “south” and “out” are two correct words, if they are combined together, it becomes an incorrect word.",
      "t15": "Common Patterns of Frequently Misspelled Words Example 10: pop + again",
      "a16": "Similarly, there is “popagain”. This word is formed by combining the two words “pop” and “again”, so it is also incorrect.",

      "a17": "Let’s look at the word “grapman”. It is formed by combining the words “grape” and “man”, and the letter “e” in “grape” has also been dropped, so this is an incorrect word.",

      "a18": "Then, let’s look at some tips provided by the Duolingo English Test Official Guide. Here, a few points are emphasized. First, the number of correct words in this part of the test is actually not fixed, so it is possible to have more or fewer correct words when answering questions. Don’t be too concerned about it.",
      "a18_1": "Second, when answering questions, be sure to carefully read the questions. Some words may look correct, but there are often cases of added, omitted, or substituted letters, so carefully distinguish them to avoid selecting the wrong option.",
      "a18_2": "Third, when answering questions, even if there are words you are unsure about, be sure to make a selection before the question time runs out. This way, you have at least a 50% chance of getting the question right. If you don’t select an answer, the question will be directly marked as incorrect.",
      "a19_h2": "Test-Taking and Preparation Suggestions",
      "a19": "Finally, let’s look at some test-taking and preparation suggestions provided by the DET Practice Exam Research Team. We should only select words that we are 100% certain are correct. When answering questions, we can use observation and reading aloud to help us make judgments.",
      "a19_1": "If a word sounds awkward or unreadable when read aloud, such as the example “guidet” we mentioned earlier, then it is likely an incorrect word. Additionally, longer words are actually easier to spot issues with, such as combinations of two or more words, incorrect roots or affixes, etc.",
      "a19_2": "Also, each word must have at least one vowel to form a syllable. We need to pay attention to these when answering questions. For regular preparation, it is recommended to practice questions in the Duolingo question bank every day during the preparation period, while also organizing incorrectly selected words and adding them to your vocabulary list.",
      "a19_3": "Use your fragmented time each day to repeatedly memorize and review, focusing on the spelling of words when memorizing. Vocabulary is accumulated slowly.

      "a1": "Hi, there. Welcome to the Advancement DET Course. Today, we will be discussing a question type called Interactive Reading. Let’s delve into the specifics of this question type.",
      "a2_h2": "1. Introduction to Interactive Reading Questions",
      "a2": "Interactive Reading questions appear twice in each exam, with each occurrence containing five types of questions, making a total of six sub-questions. These types include Complete the Sentences, Complete the Passage, Highlight the Answer, Identify the Idea, and Title the Passage. There are two sub-questions for Highlight the Answer, thus making it five types and six sub-questions in total. The difficulty decreases progressively from the first question onward. The time allocated for answering is 7 minutes for one set and 8 minutes for the other. This means you have to complete six sub-questions within 7 to 8 minutes.",
      "t2": "The First Screen of DET Interactive Reading",
      "a3": "How should we approach this question type? Firstly, it’s important to understand that the first question is the most difficult among the six sub-questions. You need not only to understand the meaning of the passage but also to distinguish between certain words, especially when synonyms are placed in the options. At this point, you need to differentiate how these words are used in the sentences and their subtle differences. This is the only way to answer correctly.",
      "a3_1": "In practice, always differentiate between the usage of vocabulary and manage your time well, as each sub-question does not have individual time limits. Therefore, allocate your time wisely for each question. Initially, you can use the elimination method, especially when the paragraphs are long and you might not have had the time to read them thoroughly, but the time is relatively tight. By analyzing the options, you can eliminate the obviously incorrect ones first, which can speed up your answering process and increase efficiency.",
      "a4_h2": "2. Complete the Sentences",
      "a4": "Let’s look at each question type in detail. The first type is Complete the Sentences. The number of blanks ranges from three to thirteen. You can see in the image that certain words are removed from a complete paragraph and placed in a dropdown menu on the right. You simply select the appropriate words from this menu. The recommended time for this question is 2 to 3 minutes, as it is relatively difficult. It’s advisable to read the entire passage first before answering since it’s a reading comprehension question. Understanding the passage will improve your accuracy. When filling in the blanks, consider the context of the sentences and paragraphs.",
      "t4": "DET Interactive Reading: Complete the Sentence",
      "a5": "Some questions will test fixed collocations and the subtle differences between synonyms and near-synonyms in the context of the sentence. Therefore, when memorizing vocabulary, it’s crucial to understand their usage. After completing your answers, review them carefully before clicking “next.” The reason for this will be explained shortly.",
      "a5_1": "This concludes our discussion on the first question type: Complete the Sentences. When attempting this type of question, always read the passage thoroughly to understand its main idea, perspective, and tense, ensuring a comprehensive grasp during the filling process. For instance, if the passage is entirely in the past tense, and you encounter a verb that’s in the present tense, it’s likely incorrect. Use these methods to eliminate wrong answers. Avoid taking phrases out of context. Look at the entire sentence or even the whole paragraph to gain more clues for selecting the right answer. Analyze the grammar, semantics, context, and differences between synonyms. Fixed collocations can also be useful in the elimination process. After selecting a word, check if the grammar is correct and if it fits as a fixed expression.",
      "a5_2": "Finally, as mentioned earlier, prioritize the elimination method, especially when dealing with long and difficult passages. Quickly eliminate the wrong answers to narrow down the correct ones, improving your accuracy.",
      "a5_3": "Now, why should you wait until all questions are completed before clicking “next”? Once you click “next,” you cannot go back to review or amend your answers. Hence, ensure all your answers are checked thoroughly before proceeding.",
      "a5_4": "Alright, let’s look at an actual question and try to solve it using the methods we’ve just discussed. First, we need to read through the entire passage, right? We can get a general idea of what it’s about, even though there are blanks. There are still quite a few remaining words, many of which are meaningful words. Let’s take a quick look.",
      "t5": "Interactive Reading: Sample Question 1",
      "a6": "Through our quick reading, we find that the passage is about a protagonist named Lenore, who wants to take on significant responsibilities within the company. However, it appears that the team members do not particularly recognize her efforts and might turn her down. The passage also mentions some possible reasons, such as “she always seems stressed out,” implying she often appears very stressed.",
      "a6_1": "One day, the manager talks to her about something, suggesting that if she sought the company’s interest, they should consider giving her a bigger role. This means giving her a more important position within the team. Lenore would be thrilled if she could play a significant role in the team, indicating she is quite eager to take on such a responsibility.",
      "a6_2": "So, the passage talks about this scenario. Now, let’s list all the options for the missing words. You may try to select the words yourself. Then, we’ll review the correct answers together. ",
      "a7_h3": "First Question Type (1st of 6 sub-questions): Complete the Sentences"
    },
    "articelContent2": {
      "a1": "Now, let’s discuss how to solve this question. For example, in the first part, ‘wanted to’, we commonly use expressions like ‘wanted to do’ or ‘want to be’. Therefore, options like ‘someone’, ‘became’, and ‘are’ can be ruled out. Considering the context, ‘want to be’ fits better than ‘want to find’ because this isn’t about finding something. In the context of the whole sentence, it should be ‘Lenore wanted to be an important part of the team.’",
      "a1_1": "In the second sentence, ‘the problem was that they didn’t think she was capable of carrying out the job,’ we are looking at the fixed phrase ‘be capable of.’ Here, ‘they’ refers to the contract management team mentioned earlier. Previously, it was stated that Lenore wanted to be an important part of the team, and now we are discussing the problem, which likely explains why Lenore hasn’t become an important part of the team yet. So, choosing ‘capable’ matches the context.",
      "a1_2": "Moving on, ‘Often when she requested a larger role on the team, they turned her down.’ We need to choose two words here: ‘often’ serves as an adverb indicating frequency, and it pairs with ‘when’ to form a time clause. The second word should be ‘they’ because the sentence is missing a subject pronoun, and ‘they’ again refers to the team previously mentioned.",
      "a1_3": "Continuing to the next sentence: ‘Perhaps that was because even though Lenore worked hard,’ we need a verb here. Given the context, it is easy to see that ‘worked’ should be chosen. The next part, ‘and got all her assignments done on time,’ indicates that Lenore worked hard and completed her tasks on time, so ‘on time’ is the appropriate choice.",
      "a1_4": "Next, ‘One day, one of the managers approached her and asked her what was wrong.’ Here, ‘what’ should be chosen because it is a fixed expression. Words like ‘they’ can be ruled out since it modifies the singular ‘was,’ not ‘were,’ so plural nouns or pronouns are incorrect here.",
      "a1_5": "Lenore said that she ‘wanted to do more.’ This tests the distinction between similar words; ‘wanted’ is used because it expresses a very strong desire, matching the earlier ‘wanted to.’",
      "a1_6": "In the next sentence, ‘The manager asked her if she thought the company should consider giving her a bigger role on the team,’ first based on the context, we can determine that the manager is asking her something, so ‘asked’ is appropriate. The phrase ‘on the team’ is used to indicate being part of the team.",
      "a1_7": "Finally, ‘and she said she would be thrilled if they did.’ Why choose ‘did’? Because ‘did’ refers to the previously mentioned ‘consider giving her a bigger role on the team.’",
      "a2_h2": "3. Complete the Passage",
      "a2": "Alright, this is the first topic we discussed. Now, let’s move on to the second topic: Complete the Passage. This task is similar to the sentence insertion questions in the TOEFL reading. For this task, we recommend spending about one minute answering it.",
      "a2_1": "We have some tips for tackling this type of question. First, make sure to read through the entire passage. The first paragraph of this task is the same as the first question of the interactive reading we did earlier, but now it has become a complete paragraph. Even if there were any incorrect word choices previously, they will be corrected here. Additionally, there will be a new supplementary paragraph.",
      "t2": "DET Interactive Reading: Complete the Passage",
      "a3": "The reason it’s called a “sentence insertion question” is that you need to choose the most appropriate sentence from the four options on the right and insert it into the correct spot in the paragraph. You should consider the relationship between the previous paragraph and the new one, such as progression, cause and effect, or referential connections.",
      "a3_1": "When answering, you can also think about the tense. Generally, the tense of the sentence to be inserted should match the tense of the surrounding paragraphs. As before, once you finish the task, take a moment to review your answer before clicking “Next” to proceed.",
      "a3_2": "Then, let’s talk about the full strategy for tackling “Complete the Passage” questions, which is the second type of question or sub-question you might encounter in this exam.",
      "a3_3": "The key here is to approach this methodically. Before you even think about choosing an answer, take a moment to read the entire text thoroughly. Your goal is to get a comprehensive understanding of the passage. You want to grasp not just what each paragraph is saying, but how they relate to each other and how the overall piece is structured.",
      "a3_4": "As you read, look for patterns in the writing. Is the author telling a story in chronological order? Are they building up to a particular point? Maybe they’re explaining a cause-and-effect relationship, or perhaps they’re contrasting different ideas. They could be classifying information into categories, or if it’s fiction, you might be seeing plot development. Understanding these structural elements will give you a significant advantage in predicting what kind of information should logically come next.",
      "a3_5": "When you turn your attention to the answer options, it’s time to put on your detective hat. Pay close attention to the details in each potential answer. Check if the tense matches the rest of the passage. Look for specific topic words that align with the text you’ve just read. Consider the pronouns – do they correctly refer to what’s been mentioned? Also, keep an eye out for transitional words that might smoothly connect ideas.",
      "a3_6": "Here’s a useful strategy: start by eliminating answers that clearly don’t fit. This narrows down your options and increases your chances of selecting the correct answer. It’s often easier to identify what’s wrong than what’s right, so use this to your advantage.",
      "a3_7": "After you’ve made your choice, don’t forget to do a quick review. Read the passage again with your selected answer in place. Ask yourself: Does it flow naturally? Does it make logical sense in the context of the whole piece? This final check can save you from simple mistakes that are easy to overlook.",
      "a3_8": "Remember, this task isn’t just about filling in a sentence. It’s about understanding how good writing flows and connects ideas. With practice, you’ll start to develop an intuition for what “sounds right” in well-constructed passages. This skill will serve you well not just in the exam, but in your reading and writing in general."
    },
    "articelContent3": {
      "a1": "Alright, let’s continue with our explanation of the sample question. The first paragraph is a bit long, but it’s the one we’ve already worked on. The final paragraph includes a new short sentence: ‘Lenore was overjoyed.’ This shows that the outcome was positive, and Lenore was very happy. ",
      "a1_1": "So, what’s the reason? We can think about it: she wanted to play an important role in the team, so it’s likely that this wish was fulfilled. In the first paragraph, the manager asked Lenore if she wanted to take on a more significant role in the company, and Lenore responded affirmatively before the paragraph ended. Therefore, the sentence to be inserted is probably describing the manager agreeing to Lenore’s request.",
      "a1_2": "Let’s analyze the options. The first one is: ‘She was so certain of this idea that she didn’t hesitate to offer it to him.’ Here, we don’t actually know what ‘this idea’ refers to, so there’s an issue with ambiguity. It wouldn’t be the correct answer as it would seem out of place in the paragraph.",
      "a1_3": "Now, let’s look at the second option: ‘The company told her that she could start her job whenever she wanted.’ This mentions starting a job, but we know Lenore isn’t just starting or new to the company, so this isn’t a correct choice either.",
      "a1_4": "Moving on to the third option: ‘With the company going out of business, Lenore was no longer needed as part of the team.’ This is clearly a negative statement, suggesting the company is shutting down and no longer needs Lenore, which would contradict the idea of her being overjoyed at the end. This doesn’t make sense.",
      "a1_5": "So, out of the four options, we’ve eliminated three. The fourth option, ‘He told her not to worry and that he would speak to the rest of the team,’ is the correct one. The manager reassured Lenore that he would talk to the rest of the team, making it the right answer.",
      "a2_h2": "4. Highlight the Answer",
      "a2": "Next, let’s look at the following task, ‘Highlight the Answer.’ This is essentially a detail question. You need to use your mouse to drag and highlight the relevant text in the passage. The selected text will be highlighted in the passage and simultaneously displayed in the text input box on the right. There are two questions of this type, and the recommended time to answer is two minutes.",
      "t2": "DET Interactive Reading: Highlight the Answer",
      "a3": "For this task, pay attention to the question words and focus on what the question is specifically asking. Then, identify the keywords in the question and locate these keywords in the passage. Since this is a detail question, your ability to pinpoint information in the passage is crucial. When selecting your answer, make sure it is accurate and complete, fully addressing the question. As before, it’s recommended to review your answer before clicking ‘next’ to proceed.",
      "a3_1": "Now let’s discuss the strategy for the third question type, which covers the 3rd and 4th sub-questions: Highlight the Answer. This type of question requires a different approach than the previous ones we’ve discussed.",
      "a3_2": "The first step in tackling these questions is to carefully examine the specific question words used. These are typically interrogative words like “When,” “How,” “Why,” “Which,” “Where,” or “What.” These words are crucial because they indicate exactly what kind of information you’re looking for in the passage.",
      "a3_3": "Next, you’ll want to focus on the keywords in the question. These are the important content words that relate directly to the topic of the passage. Your task is to find where these words, or their synonyms, appear in the original text. This is a critical skill because sometimes the passage won’t use the exact same words as the question, but rather synonyms or related terms. By quickly locating these keywords or their equivalents, you can efficiently pinpoint the area of the text where the answer is likely to be found.",
      "a3_4": "It’s important to note that the answer you’re looking for should be accurate and complete in addressing the question. However, don’t get caught up in trying to find or formulate a full sentence as the answer. Sometimes the correct response might be just a phrase, a name, or even a single word. The key is that it fully answers the question asked, regardless of its length or grammatical structure.",
      "a3_5": "This type of question tests your ability to quickly scan and comprehend text, to recognize synonyms and related concepts, and to extract precise information from a larger context. It’s a valuable skill not just for this test, but for efficient reading and information gathering in general.",
      "a3_6": "Remember, practice is key to developing this skill. The more you work with these types of questions, the better you’ll become at quickly identifying the relevant information in a passage. This will not only improve your test performance but also enhance your overall reading comprehension abilities."
    },
    "articelContent4": {
      "a1": "Alright, let’s continue with the sample question. First, let’s look at the question: ‘What was Lenore’s goal at her company?’ It asks about Lenore’s goal, which refers to what she wanted to achieve. Understanding it this way makes it easier to find the answer.",
      "a1_1": "Where is the answer to this question? We need to find a corresponding relationship. Here, ‘goal’ corresponds to ‘wanted to be’ in the text. This helps us identify the answer. It should be a part of the first sentence: ‘Lenore wanted to be an important part of her company’s contract management team.’",
      "a1_2": "Alright, let’s move on to the next question: ‘How did Lenore respond when her manager asked her if she wanted an expanded role?’"
    },
    "articelContent5": {
      "a1": "This question asks about Lenore’s response. We can identify more keywords in the question to help locate the answer, such as ‘manager’ and ‘an expanded role,’ which corresponds to ‘a big role.’ By understanding this correspondence, we can find the answer: ‘she said she would be thrilled if they did.’",
      "a2_h2": "5. Identify the Idea",
      "a2": "Next, let’s look at the fourth question type, which is the fifth item: ‘Identify the Idea.’ From the four options on the right, choose the one that best summarizes the main idea of the passage. This question will appear once in the actual exam, and the recommended time to answer is one minute.",
      "t2": "DET Interactive Reading: Identify the Idea",
      "a3": "When tackling this question, be careful not to choose options that are not supported by the text or that contradict the text, as these are definitely incorrect. Additionally, if you can find a sentence in the passage that has the same meaning or is a close synonym, that option is very likely to be the correct answer. The correct answer does not need to summarize the entire passage. Finally, try to review your answer before clicking ‘Next.’",
      "a3_1": "Moving on to the strategies. The first strategy to employ here is the elimination method. Start by carefully examining each answer option and look for nouns or key terms that aren’t mentioned anywhere in the original text. If you find an option that contains words or concepts not present in the passage, you can safely rule it out. This method helps narrow down your choices quickly and efficiently.",
      "a3_2": "For most of these questions, your task will be to select an option that accurately represents the meaning of a specific sentence or a group of sentences from the text. Essentially, you’re searching for synonymous expressions or paraphrases of the original content. This requires you to understand not just the words, but the underlying concepts and ideas presented in the passage.",
      "a3_3": "To tackle this effectively, make sure you locate the corresponding content in the text for each answer option. This means you’ll need to read the passage carefully and match each possible answer to a specific part of the text. Look for options that capture the main idea or key point of the relevant section, even if they use different words to express it.",
      "a3_4": "A crucial point to remember is to avoid taking things out of context or making unfounded assumptions. Stick closely to what the text actually says, rather than inferring or extrapolating beyond the information given. The correct answer should be firmly grounded in the passage itself.",
      "a3_5": "This question type tests your reading comprehension at a higher level, assessing your ability to synthesize information and recognize ideas expressed in different ways. It’s not just about finding matching words, but about understanding and identifying core concepts.",
      "a3_6": "Developing this skill requires practice in paraphrasing and summarizing texts. As you prepare, try restating passages in your own words to get better at recognizing when two differently-worded statements are expressing the same idea. This will not only help you with these questions but also improve your overall reading and analytical skills."
    },
    "articelContent6": {
      "a1": "Alright, let’s get back to the question. Here we have four options, and we’ll see which one is the correct answer. For this type of question, the process of elimination is the best approach. As we mentioned earlier, do not choose options that are not supported by the text or that contradict the text.",
      "a1_1": "For example, the first option, ‘get a new job,’ is not mentioned in the text. The second option, ‘new team,’ is also not mentioned in the text. Now, let’s look at the third option, ‘her assistant,’ which is not mentioned in the text either. This makes it easy to determine that the fourth option is the correct answer.",
      "a1_2": "Let’s double-check: the fourth option actually corresponds to the third and fourth sentences of the passage: ‘Often when she requested a larger role on the team, they turned her down. Perhaps that was because even though Lenore worked hard and got all her assignments done on time, she always seemed stressed out.’ So, even though this option doesn’t summarize the entire passage, it is indeed the correct answer."
    },
    "articelContent7": {
      "a1_h2": "6. Title the Passage",
      "a1": "Alright, let’s look at the final question: Title the Passage. In the actual exam, this question will appear once per set, and the recommended time to answer is also one minute. This question is quite simple; we just need to choose the title of the passage.",
      "t1": "DET Interactive Reading: Title the Passage"
    },
    "articelContent8": {
      "a1": "When answering this question, focus on identifying the core topic of the passage. Use the process of elimination first, carefully read all the options, and make sure to review your choice before clicking ‘Next.’",
      "a1_1": "Strategies time, first and foremost, employ the elimination method. This strategy is particularly effective here. Carefully examine each answer option and look for nouns or key terms that aren’t mentioned anywhere in the original text. If you find an option containing words that are completely absent from the passage, you can confidently rule it out. This approach helps you quickly narrow down your choices to the most relevant options.",
      "a1_2": "Next, pay close attention to options that include the core topic words of the passage. These are often the correct choices. The core topic words are those that appear frequently or carry significant weight in conveying the main subject of the text. A good title typically incorporates these key terms as they encapsulate what the passage is fundamentally about.",
      "a1_3": "However, don’t just focus on individual words. The most crucial aspect is to identify the main idea conveyed in the article. A good title should encapsulate the overarching theme or central message of the entire passage. It’s not just about finding a phrase that appears in the text, but about summarizing the essence of what the author is trying to communicate.",
      "a1_4": "Be cautious of options that, while perhaps using words from the text, are unfounded or inconsistent with the original content. A title should accurately represent the passage, not mislead or exaggerate certain aspects. Avoid selecting options that only focus on minor details or tangential points mentioned in the text.",
      "a1_5": "This question type requires you to step back and look at the big picture. It tests your ability to synthesize information and identify the core message amidst all the details. As you read the passage, try to continuously ask yourself, “What is this text primarily about?” or “What’s the author’s main point?”",
      "a1_6": "Developing this skill is not only useful for the test but also enhances your overall reading comprehension and analytical abilities. It forces you to engage with the text at a deeper level, understanding not just what is being said, but why it’s being said and what the overall purpose of the passage is."
    },
    "articelContent9": {
      "a1": "Let’s look at the final question. First, let’s review the possible titles. The first one, ‘Lenore’s New Job,’ talks about her new job, which is definitely incorrect. The second one, ‘The Challenging Contract,’ does not mention anything about a contract. The third one, ‘The Client’s Complaint,’ also does not relate to anything mentioned in the passage. Therefore, the fourth one, ‘Lenore’s Big Chance,’ is the correct answer. This ‘big chance’ refers to the ‘big role’ that Lenore is about to have. Alright, that concludes our discussion of the questions."

    "p_3": "Hi there, and welcome to the DET Practice Prep Hub. Today, we’re going to discuss the “Read and Complete” question type. Let’s start by looking at its distribution. We can see that the “Read and Complete” questions fall under comprehension. This makes them similar to the reading choices and interactive reading tasks we’ve previously covered, all of which are important objective question types. It’s recommended to focus on practicing these types of questions frequently during your study sessions.",
    "h2_4": "Understanding the Question Format",
    "p_4": "Now, let’s introduce the question type. First, let’s take a look at the interface.",
    "p_5": "By observing the layout, we can see that “Read and Complete” questions are timed at three minutes. These questions present a short text with some missing words. The text includes a title, complete opening and closing sentences, and some sentences in the middle with blanks. The task is to fill in the missing words from the text.",
    "h2_5": "Key Strategies for Success",
    "p_6": "In each test, you’ll encounter 3 to 6 “Read and Complete” questions. The requirement is straightforward: fill in the missing words. However, it’s not as simple as it seems. There are several reasons for this. First, the topics vary widely, ranging from dialogues and expository writing to argumentative essays and scientific articles. Additionally, the missing words must be filled in as part of the text, so spelling is crucial. This means that a broad vocabulary and strong reading skills are essential.",
    "p_7": "Furthermore, this is also a reading comprehension task. Many times, you will need to rely on the context and background of the text to fill in the blanks, which tests your ability to understand sentences and the overall passage. In some cases, your knowledge of grammar and syntax will provide useful clues for completing the task. These aspects are also tested.",
    "p_8": "So, how should you approach the “Read and Complete” questions? Let’s look at some strategies.",
    "h2_6": "Importance of Context and Comprehension",

    "p_10": "When tackling “Read and Complete” questions, it’s important to focus on the full text, especially the title, complete sentences, and the overall structure, tense, and tone of the passage. While answering, don’t just focus on the blank and the nearby words. Instead, consider the entire sentence or even the whole passage to gather clues or find the correct answer. Now, let’s take a look at the following example question:",
    "title1": "A Strong but Limited Job Candidate",
    "p_11": "In some ways, she is a strong candidate for a position with our company. Her tech <span class='blank'></span><span class='blank'></span><span class='blank'></span><span class='blank'></span><span class='blank'></span> knowledge i<span class='blank'></span> well ah <span class='blank'></span><span class='blank'></span><span class='blank'></span> of mo <span class='blank'></span><span class='blank'></span> of o <span class='blank'></span><span class='blank'></span> current work <span class='blank'></span><span class='blank'></span><span class='blank'></span><span class='blank'></span><span class='blank'></span>.

This is something she can work on once she joins our team.",
    "p_12": "First, we’ll start with the title “A Strong but Limited Job Candidate”. So what does that mean? It suggests that the interviewee may excel in certain areas and stand out, but also has some shortcomings. This is just our initial interpretation based on the title. Now, let’s check if the content of the passage aligns with this assumption. ",
    "p_13": "Let’s move on to the first sentence: “In some ways, she is a strong candidate for a position with our company.” This means that, in certain aspects, she is a strong contender for the role at our company. Now, let’s look at the closing sentence: “This is something she can work on once she joins our team.” Once she joins the team, she can focus on improving something. We need to figure out what this something refers to. Moving on to the body of the text, it seems to focus on two parts: the candidate’s strengths and the areas where she can improve. The something in the closing sentence likely refers to the areas that need improvement.",
    "p_14": "Through contextual analysis, we’ve developed a fairly good understanding of the question. Now, let’s fill in these missing words together:",
    "p_15": "The first word starts with ‘tech’. We might think it’s related to technology, as ‘tech’ itself is an informal term for technology. Could it be ‘technology’? The number of spaces doesn’t fit, right? We only have 5 spaces to fill, meaning we can only fit 5 letters. The next word is ‘knowledge’, a noun, so the ‘tech’ word before it is likely an adjective modifying ‘knowledge’, forming a noun phrase. An adjective starting with ‘tech’   ‘technological’ is too long, but what about ‘technical’? Ah, that fits perfectly. This word can mean both ‘technical’ and ‘professional’, so ‘technical knowledge’ works well here.",
    "p_16": "Moving on, the second word, something ‘well’, starts with ‘i’ and has two letters. Looking at the whole sentence, it should be a simple sentence, not very long, probably describing some of the candidate’s strengths. We’ve already analyzed that this text has two parts, discussing the candidate’s strengths and limitations. This should be a subject verb complement structure, so the ‘i’ word is likely the verb ‘is’.",
    "p_17": "Since we’re describing strengths, there should be a comparison. Who would a candidate be compared to? Possibly other interviewees, right? But we notice the text doesn’t mention other candidates. We see an important word, ‘current’, meaning ‘present’ or ‘now’. Could it be referring to their colleagues? Possibly. We see a word starting with ‘work’ that refers to people. We might first think of ‘workers’, but there are more spaces. Colleagues can be ‘coworkers’ or ‘workmates’, but we need a word starting with ‘work’. It should be ‘workmate’, but there are 5 spaces, right? So we add an ‘s’: ‘workmates’, which fits perfectly.",
    "p_18": "For the space before ‘current’, we need a 3 letter word starting with ‘o’. Do we need to spend time thinking about it? I wouldn’t, because it’s in the text. Look at the last sentence, what’s before ‘team’? ‘Our’   isn’t that perfect? A 3 letter word starting with ‘o’, we can fill it right in. Is it common for words to be filled in from the original text? ",
    "p_19": "Actually, it’s quite common, so I remind students again: read first, then fill in the blanks. Remember these six words.",
    "p_20": "Now we’re left with the words before and after ‘of’. The word starting with ‘a’ should be ‘ahead’. We’re describing strengths, so consider the phrase ‘be ahead of’, meaning to be in front, surpass, or lead. The word starting with ‘m’ after ‘of’ should be ‘most’, meaning the majority. So her technical knowledge is better than most of our current workmates.",
    "p_21": "Moving to the next sentence, ‘But’ indicates a transition, so now we’ll discuss the candidate’s weaknesses. The word starting with ‘s’ should be ‘she’, as we’re missing a subject. The word after ‘has’ is easy to guess, it should be ‘some’   she has some shortcomings or limitations. The word starting with ‘a’ before ‘well’ is likely ‘as well’, often appearing at the end of a sentence to mean ‘also’ or ‘too’. After ‘Based’, it should be ‘on’, ‘based on’ meaning ‘according to’. The word after ‘my’ is long but should be easy to guess  probably ‘interview’, as we’re discussing an interviewee. After ‘with’, it should be ‘her’, her interview. The ‘h’ word before ",
    "p_22": "‘communication’ should also be ‘her’, a possessive pronoun. The word starting with ‘ski’ should be ‘skills’, interpersonal communication skills. Since there’s ‘are’, we use the plural form of ‘skill’. We’re discussing the candidate’s weaknesses, so it should be in the negative form, ‘are not strong’. So the word starting with ‘n’ is ‘not’. But the last word to fill in, starting with ‘stre’, doesn’t match the spelling of ‘strong’, and there’s an article ‘a’ before it, so it should be a noun. What’s the noun form of ‘strong’? ‘Strength’.",
    "p_23": "Alright, we’ve completed this question. Here is the answer:",
    "title2": "A Strong but Limited Job Candidate",
    "p_24": "In some ways, she is a strong candidate for a position with our company.

    "p_27": "In every exam, the probability of encountering unfamiliar words is quite high. For reading comprehension and fill in the blank questions, guessing word meanings becomes a necessary step. So, if you come across unknown words or phrases while solving problems, try to infer their general meaning from root words, affixes, parts of speech, synonyms, antonyms, and so on.

Let’s try to translate this title: it’s about threats to ‘C’ in Africa. ‘Threats’ is plural, indicating there’s more than one threat. Remember our problem solving steps? Read first, then fill in the blanks. Good.",
    "p_31": "Let’s look at the article. The first sentence says, ‘The biggest threats to the common chimpanzee are habitat destruction, poaching, and disease.’ This gives us crucial information to narrow down what ‘C’ might be: habitat and disease suggest that ‘C’ could be a plant or animal.",
    "p_32": "If you don’t know ‘destruction’, think of a word like ‘construction’. We know ‘con ‘ as a prefix means ‘together’, ‘struct’ means ‘build’ or ‘pile up’, and ‘ ion’ is a suffix indicating an action or process. Now, replace ‘con ‘ with ‘de ‘, which means ‘down’ or ‘away’, so we can roughly understand ‘habitat destruction’ as ‘damage to living areas’.",
    "p_33": "Given this context, ‘poaching’ is likely not a positive term and probably refers to something threatening to ‘C’.",
    "p_34": "Looking at the last sentence: ‘While deforestation rates are low in western Central Africa, selective logging may be done outside national parks.’ We see ‘deforestation’   ‘forest’ means woods, and we’ve explained ‘ ion’. ‘De ‘ means removal, so ‘deforestation’ means cutting down forests. ‘Log’ means to cut trees. So this refers to tree cutting in Central Africa.",
    "p_35": "At this point, ‘C’ is most likely an animal. If it were a plant, we’d probably see mentions of climate, weather, or ‘C’ being cut down. But we don’t see that.",
    "p_36": "We also see the word ‘population’ in the article, which can refer to a group of organisms. Based on this understanding, let’s start filling in the blanks.",
    "p_37": "The first word to fill in comes after ‘chimpanzee’ and starts with ‘habi’. Is it in the article? Yes, it’s in the first sentence: ‘habitat’. From ‘have’ that follows, we can deduce it should be plural: ‘habitats’. What comes after ‘have’? We see ‘limited’, but habitats can’t actively perform an action, right? So this should be in passive voice, and it’s in the present perfect tense, indicating a result or consequence. Therefore, we fill in ‘been’. After ‘limited’, it should be ‘by’.",
    "p_38": "Next, we have words before and after ‘both’. Notice at the end of the sentence, we see ‘and Central Africa’. ‘Central Africa’ is a place name, and ‘and’ indicates a parallel structure, so the word before it should be ‘West’. Therefore, the word before ‘both’ should be the preposition ‘in’.",
    "p_39": "The word after ‘road’ starting with ‘buil’ is easily guessed as ‘building’. The word after ‘has’ starting with ‘cau’ should be a past participle. As it’s in the present perfect, it’s ’caused’. How has it affected the habitat? These two words are quite difficult, so let’s leave them for now.",
    "p_40": "Moving on, we should fill in ‘chimpanzee’, which is in the article. Before ‘may’, it should be ‘and’ to indicate a parallel structure. We see ‘poacher’, which must be the person doing the ‘poaching’ mentioned earlier, right? It’s a word ending in ‘ er’, similar to ‘teaching’ and ‘teacher’. But this ‘poacher’ isn’t doing anything good. What about the word starting with ‘al’? Think about it   we’re talking about road building, so it should be ‘allow’. Now that there are roads, it’s more convenient for them to poach, so we should fill in ‘more access to areas’.",
    "p_41": "The word starting with ‘th’ should be ‘that’. How did we deduce this? It’s a relative clause, and ‘that’ is a relative pronoun. The word starting with ‘n’ after ‘had’ should be ‘not’. After ‘been’, we need an adverb modifying the verb ‘affected’, so fill in ‘seriously’. The last one is ‘by’ because it’s in passive voice.",
    "p_42": "Now, let’s look at the two long words in the middle. We said this sentence is about road construction. If we build roads in the habitats where these animals live, won’t it divide their habitats? Certainly. The word starting with ‘fragme’ is easily guessed as ‘fragment’, meaning ‘piece’ or ‘part’, but there aren’t enough letters. Could it be ‘fragmentation’? Yes, the letter count matches perfectly. This word means ‘breaking into pieces’ and can be translated here as ‘fragmentation’.",
    "p_43": "What about the word starting with ‘degra’? It should be ‘degradation’. ‘Habitat degradation’ can be translated as ‘deterioration of living environment’. This phrase is often used to describe the process of natural environment quality decline, which may be due to natural processes like drought, heat, and cold or human activities such as forestry, agriculture, and urbanization. This degradation may cause the natural habitat that originally supported native species to become unsuitable for their survival. Alright, we’ve completed the question.

    "p_76": "Let’s start filling in the blanks. For the first one, should it be ‘is’, ‘in’, or ‘it’? Looking ahead, we see a long word starting with ‘constr ‘, which is likely ‘construction’. Why? Because cement and concrete are both construction materials. That’s easy to guess.",
    "p_77": "The opening sentence says people often confuse the two, but here we have ‘however’, and later we see the word ‘different’, indicating that these two are indeed different. So we can infer that in the construction field, these two need to be distinguished. Therefore, it should be ‘in the’. How do we say ‘field’? It could be ‘field’ or ‘area’, but it’s a word starting with ‘w’, so it’s ‘world’, which works better here.",

    "p_10": "Additionally, this question primarily tests your mastery of word pronunciation and spelling, so your vocabulary will be a key determinant of your score. In your daily practice, focus on expanding your vocabulary. When presented with this question, sometimes the sentences are longer, so you can first focus on remembering the content words, such as nouns, adjectives, and verbs. In the second and third listens, you can fill in the function words, such as prepositions and particles. While listening, you can also leverage your grammatical and syntactic knowledge along with context to fill in the blanks. This concludes our introduction to this question type and some general test-taking tips. Next, let’s discuss answering strategies.",
    "h2_5": "Handling Numbers",
    "gray4": "DET Answering Strategies",
    "p_11": "Before that, let’s address a common question from many students: what should we do when we hear numbers? Should we write them as numerals or spell them out? Let’s look at the official guidance. The official answer is to write them out using English words. This means we should write numbers as words, not numerals. If you encounter years, such as 1986 or 2002, you can write them as numerals. For other types of numbers, write them out as words. Do not use Arabic numerals. For example, if you hear “sixteen,” write it as a word, not as the number 16.",
    "h2_6": "Utilizing the Three Audio Plays",
    "p_12": "Now, how can you best utilize the three audio plays? Let’s take a look. Since the Duolingo English Test does not allow notetaking, you should start typing what you hear during the first listen. For longer words, you don’t need to write out the entire word at once. For example, with a long word like “congratulations,” writing out the entire word will take considerable time, and you might fall behind on the remaining words. For such words, you can try writing the first few letters and then complete the word later.",
    "p_13": "After the first listen, resist the urge to mentally translate or deeply process the meaning of the sentence. Some test-takers do this, pondering the sentence’s meaning, but it consumes valuable time and mental energy. Instead, you can mechanically repeat it in your mind or softly verbalize it to reinforce your short-term memory. Try to capture the sentence’s core structure, such as the subject and verb, along with key content words. In the second listen, fill in the grammatical words, such as prepositions and particles.",
    "p_14": "Use the third play to check for any missed words and to ensure the completeness of your transcription. If time remains after the three listens, you can use your grammatical knowledge and understanding of sentence structure to refine your response. Also, double-check your spelling and punctuation. This is how you can optimally utilize the three audio plays.",
    "h2_7": "Key Phonetic Phenomena",
    "p_15": "Next, let’s examine some key phonetic phenomena. First, we have the linking that occurs between a word-final consonant and a word-initial vowel, such as in “get out” and “stand up.” Then, there is assimilation, where /t/ plus /j/ becomes /ʧ/ and /d/ plus /j/ becomes /ʤ/, as in “next year” and “did you.” There is also linking with the /r/ sound, as in “her own” and “answer it.” Additionally, for vowel-to-vowel linking, we can insert a gentle /w/ between vowels, as in “go on” and “who else.” For words ending in a vowel followed by another vowel, we can insert a /j/, as in “be on time” and “my only apartment.”",
    "p_16": "Another phenomenon is the loss of plosion, where in certain combinations of the six plosive sounds, the first one is not fully articulated, as in “black bike” and “sit down.” Consonant clusters can also occur, as in “sad day” and “fresh shirt.”",
    "h1_3": "• Weak Forms",
    "p_17": "Weak forms can be even more complex. Let’s look at some examples. The symbols in black represent the full pronunciation, while those in red represent the weak forms. For example, “tell us the truth” can be reduced to “tell us the truth” in rapid speech. Possessive pronouns can also be weakened, with “her” becoming /ər/. For instance, “she has lost her watch” can be reduced to “she’s lost ‘er watch.” Conjunctions and prepositions like “but” can weaken to /bət/, as in “but I don’t understand” being pronounced more like “bət I don’t understand.” Auxiliary verbs like “can” can reduce to /kən/, as in “What can you do?” sounding more like “What kən you do?”",

    "h2_8": "Practice Questions",
    "p_19": "Next, let’s look at some specific practice questions. For example, this question is in the range of 100 points or less. Let’s give it a try.",
    "p_20": "You can prepare a piece of paper and a pen, or open a blank document on your computer. You can play the audio then transcribe what you hear. Since this question is fairly straightforward, make the allotted time brief. Feel free to check the answer to this question below:",
    "p_21": "In this sentence, there is a phonetic reduction where the /t/ sound in “don’t” is weakened. For sentences in this scoring range, they tend to be short and simple, so you can likely transcribe them in real-time. When writing, be mindful of punctuation and capitalization.",
    "p_22": "Let’s move on to the next question. You may play it three times; try to write down what you hear. It’s very brief.",
    "p_23": "And here is the answer:",
    "p_24": "Attentive students may have noticed the linking that occurs between “have” and “a.”",
    "p_25": "Let’s proceed to the next question.",
    "p_26": "You may play the audio above, then write down the answer on your draft paper, or type the sentence on your computer screen.",
    "p_27": "Here, the /t/ sound in “winter event” is weakened, and there is linking between the words.",
    "p_28": "Now let’s tackle a more challenging question, in the 105-115 point range.",
    "p_29": "It’s a bit lengthy, so give yourself some extra time.",
    "p_30": "Take note of the word “centenarian,” which refers to a person who is one hundred years old or older. It might be an unfamiliar word, so ensure you spell it correctly. There is also linking in “or more.” Remember to write out numbers as words, such as “one hundred,” rather than using numerals.",
    "p_31": "Let’s attempt the next question.",
    "p_32": "You may play the audio above for 3 times then check your answer.",
    "p_33": "Here, the /t/ sound in “results” is omitted, and “displayed” links with “at.” There is also linking in the phrase “bottom of.”",
    "p_34": "Next, let’s try another question.",
    "p_35": "When play the audio, try to write down as many words as possible.",
    "p_36": "The challenge here lies in spelling “plasma” and “membrane,” which refer to the liquid component of blood and a thin, pliable sheet of tissue, respectively. This question assesses your vocabulary knowledge.",
    "p_37": "If you’re familiar with these words, the sentence is fairly straightforward. If not, try to phonetically spell the words based on their pronunciation. It’s better to write down your best guess than to leave a blank space.",
    "p_38": "Let’s try another, even more challenging question. This time, it’s a question worth 120 points or more.",
    "p_39": "This sentence is quite long and contains several advanced vocabulary words.",
    "p_40": "Pay close attention to the lengthy words “prevention,” “vaccination,” and “environmental.” Also, note the punctuation rules for listing items in a series. Write down the content words first, then go back and fill in function words like “of” and “and.” Double-check for singular and plural forms, as well as third-person singular verb agreement, as in “includes.”",
    "p_41": "Let’s look at another high-value question.",
    "p_42": "Once again, pay attention to the advanced vocabulary, including “information,” “particular,” and “mathematical.”",
    "p_43": "There is linking in “theory is,” “of a,” and “concept of.” Weak forms, such as “of” reducing to /əv/, are also present. Employ the same strategy: write down the content words first, then go back and fill in the function words.",
    "p_44": "Next, let’s examine one final question.",
    "p_45": "If you encounter unfamiliar words, be sure to add them to your personal vocabulary list for further study.",
    "p_46": "The word “perpendicular” means “at a right angle” and is quite lengthy and potentially challenging to spell. There is linking in “surface of” and “an object.”",
    "p_47": "For these longer sentences, it’s crucial that your typing speed is up to par. Practice typing using writing samples drawn from your question bank. This will help improve your speed while also familiarizing you with model sentences and phrasings.",

It is designed to evaluate a test taker’s ability to understand spoken English in real-world contexts. In this task, the user listens to short audio clips, often involving conversations, and is prompted to answer comprehension questions and interact with the content by selecting the appropriate responses. This question type emphasizes quick understanding, attention to detail, and the ability to respond accurately to spoken information, reflecting practical listening skills necessary for real-life communication. Let’s start by looking at an introduction to the first part of the interactive listening section.",
    "h2_4": "Part 1: Listen and Respond",
    "p_4": "Part 1 is called ‘Listen and Respond’ and consists of multiple-choice questions, similar to those found in other English listening tests. Test-takers need to select the correct option from several choices. This section appears twice in each exam, with 5 to 6 multiple-choice questions each time. You’ll have 4 minutes to complete this part, and it’s important to note that the audio will only be played once – there’s no option to replay it.",
    "p_5": "In this section, you’ll be assigned a role in the conversation, essentially participating in the dialogue. This means the conversation unfolds from a first-person perspective, although you won’t need to speak during the listening part.",
    "p_6": "For this section, we still recommend memorizing and mastering some scenario-specific vocabulary beforehand, especially focusing on pronunciation. This will help you quickly recognize and understand words during listening comprehension.",

    "h2_5": "Types of Interactive Listening Questions",
    "p_8": "Now, let’s take a look at the categories of ‘interactive listening’ questions. Up to this point, based on the identities of the speakers in the listening dialogues, ‘interactive listening’ questions can be broadly divided into two types: student-to-student and student-to-teacher conversations. The number of speakers in these dialogues is consistently two; there haven’t been any multi-person conversations with more than two participants so far. In terms of scenarios, they can be roughly categorized into two types: discussions about problems and solutions, and Q and A sessions about classroom content or academic issues.",
    "gray1": "Interactive Listening Categories",
    "p_9": "You can refer to the diagram above for a clearer overview.",
    "h2_6": "Answering Strategies for Listen and Respond",
    "p_10": "Alright, let’s now go through a sample question to explain the answering strategies for interactive listening questions. You can take a break from reading to practice, then come back to the article for explanations. Here’s a link to some sample questions: <a href='https://englishtest.duolingo.com/sample-question?type=aic&amp;scenario=student-student' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>https://englishtest.duolingo.com/sample-question?type=aic&amp;scenario=student-student</a>",
    "p_11": "Let’s look at this question.",
    "p_12": "Before the listening section begins, we’ll see a scenario like this. Look at the first bolded sentence: ‘You will participate in a conversation about the scenario below.’ It’s important to note that, unlike other English exams, in the DET, you, the test-taker, are assumed to be one of the characters in the listening scenario. That’s why you’ll see the word ‘You’ in the scenario introduction.",
    "gray2": "Interactive Listening Demo Scenario",
    "p_13": "Let’s look at the specific scenario: ‘You are considering taking a year off between high school and university and are discussing it with your friend. They think it’s a great idea, but you’re not sure if you want to wait another year before going to university.’",
    "p_14": "This scenario provides a lot of information. First, let’s look at the sentence: ‘You are considering taking a year off between high school and university, and are discussing it with your friend.’ This establishes your identity as a high school graduate about to enter university. You want to discuss this matter with your friend.",
    "p_15": "Then, the scenario states: ‘They think it’s a great idea, but you’re not sure if you want to wait another year before going to university.’ This means your friend thinks it’s a good idea, but you’re not certain.",
    "p_16": "Now, let’s discuss how to use this scenario to help answer questions. Firstly, the scenario can serve as a basis for judging the answers to the listening multiple-choice questions, especially for the first two questions. The answers are likely to be found within this scenario. Note that during the 4-minute answering period, the scenario will remain visible. You can scroll the right side of the screen to review this section at any time. So, if you’re unsure about a question, remember to come back and check if there are any clues or hints in the scenario.",
    "p_17": "Secondly, this scenario summarizes the main content of the listening to some extent, so it can be used as a reference for writing in Part 2 of this question, which we’ll discuss later.",
    "p_18": "Now let’s look at the specific questions. In this question, we first need to click the play button to listen to the audio.",
    "p_19": "Here, your friend asks, ‘Have you decided what you are going to do next year?’ They’re inquiring about your plans for next year. Referring to the scenario, we know that you’re considering a gap year. So, it’s easy to find the correct answer, which is the first option. Let’s look at the wording of the first answer: ‘I’m thinking about taking a year off before going to university.’ This matches exactly with the scenario’s ‘You are considering taking a year off between high school and university.’ So, if you’re unsure about a question, always remember to compare it with the scenario – you might quickly find the correct answer.",
    "p_20": "Let’s continue to the next question. Now, your friend says, ‘That’s a great idea! I’ve been thinking about doing the same thing.’ This means they’re considering a gap year just like you. How would you respond to this? Let’s look at the answer choices.",
    "p_21": "Remember, we mentioned that for the first one or two questions, the scenario is crucial for selecting the answer. By comparing with the scenario, we find that option three aligns with the scenario’s description – you’re still not sure about taking a gap year. So, you can directly choose this as the correct answer.",
    "p_22": "Then your friend says: ‘Yeah, I know it’s a big decision, but I think it would be a really great experience. You get to travel and learn new things and meet new people.’ They mention some benefits of a gap year, which allows you to have free time to travel, learn new things, and meet new people. How would you respond? Let’s look at the options below.",
    "p_23": "Although we can’t always use the scenario to help us judge, we can still analyze the options to answer the question. Here’s our analysis:",
    "p_24": "First, option 1 mentions psychology, a specific subject, but from the previous conversation, we know this wasn’t mentioned. So, it’s not the correct answer.",
    "p_25": "Option 2 ends with ‘that one,’ but we’re not clear what ‘that one’ refers to. This ambiguity allows us to eliminate this option.",
    "p_26": "Option 3 mentions travel, which partially overlaps with what your friend just said. Let’s keep this one in mind.",
    "p_27": "Looking at the last two options, one mentions London and a job, while the other mentions Japan. These weren’t mentioned in the conversation, so we can eliminate them.",
    "p_28": "Therefore, we can conclude that option 3, which we kept earlier, is the correct answer.",
    "p_29": "Let’s continue and see what your friend says next. She says: ‘And there are so many different options. You could volunteer or work or even just take some time off to relax and figure out what you want to do with your life.’ Here, your friend is giving some options for what you could do during a gap year. She’s still listing the benefits of taking a gap year. Let’s look at how you might respond.",
    "p_30": "Option 1 mentions travel again, but it says you wouldn’t travel alone. This wasn’t mentioned in the previous conversation, so we can rule it out.",
    "p_31": "Option 2 has several issues that indicate it’s not the correct answer. First, the use of ‘that’ is ambiguous – your friend mentioned many options, so we can’t use the singular pronoun ‘that’ to replace them all. Also, the question ‘What do you want to go after that?’ seems to be asking about plans after the gap year, which wasn’t mentioned earlier in the conversation. So, we can eliminate this option.",
    "p_32": "Option 3, suggesting your friend go to the library and do research, goes against common sense. While you can plan for a gap year in advance, it doesn’t require library research. This can be eliminated.",
    "p_33": "Option 4 mentions an end-of-term paper, which hasn’t appeared anywhere in the conversation. This answer is fabricated and can be ruled out.",
    "p_34": "Therefore, option 5 is the correct answer, as we’ve eliminated all the previous options. This option mentions the real reason for your uncertainty about taking a gap year, as stated in the scenario – you’re worried that your parents might not agree with this choice.",
    "p_35": "Continuing with the listening part, your friend now says: ‘You could talk to them about it and see what they think. It’s definitely worth considering!’ She’s suggesting that you talk to your parents and see what they think. This is a practical suggestion, so you should reasonably accept it and express gratitude.",
    "p_36": "Let’s look at the options below to see which one fits. After comparing, we find that option 3, which agrees to talk to your parents, is the most appropriate answer, so it’s correct.",
    "p_37": "With this, we’ve completed the listening part. This concludes Part 1 of the ‘interactive listening’ section in the DET.",
    "h2_7": "Part 2: Summarize the Conversation",
    "p_38": "Next, let’s look at Part 2 of the ‘interactive listening’ question: Summarize the Conversation. In this section, we have 75 seconds to summarize the content of the previous listening dialogue. Remember what we mentioned earlier: the scenario can be used as a reference for writing the summary. However, note that the scenario and conversation text are not visible in this part. So, this section largely relies on the test-taker’s short-term memory.",
    "p_39": "Here’s an additional tip: while doing Part 1 of the ‘interactive listening’ question, we have 4 minutes to complete it. Often, we don’t use all 4 minutes. So, if you’ve finished all the multiple-choice questions in the remaining time of Part 1, you can spend some time memorizing the main content of the scenario and listening text. This will help you write more content when you get to the Summarize the Conversation part.",
    "h2_8": "Writing Templates for Different Question Types",
    "p_40": "Now, let’s look at the writing template for the ‘Problem/Solution Discussion Type,’ which is the type of conversation we just heard. You can pause this video and take a screenshot to save this template. Notice that we’ve used different colors to mark sentences in the template: blue for relatively fixed content, red for content that can be chosen based on the context, and black for content that needs to be replaced.",
    "p_41": "– Problem/Solution Discussion Type:",
    "p_42": "Similarly, we’ve provided a version with upgraded vocabulary:",
    "p_43": "– Problem/Solution Discussion Type:",
    "p_44": "For students with a better foundation or aiming for higher scores, you can screenshot and save this advanced template for future practice reference.",
    "p_45": "Regarding the use of template sentences, let’s add a few more tips: When using templates for your responses, it’s important to keep a few key points in mind. First and foremost, always make sure your content stays relevant to the topic at hand. Don’t try to force the template to fit if it doesn’t quite work – that can lead to awkward or inappropriate usage.",
    "p_46": "As you work through multiple questions, be careful not to repeat the same points over and over. This can make your responses feel repetitive and less engaging. It’s also crucial to double-check your spelling, grammar, and syntax in the template sentences. Small errors can really stand out and detract from your message.",
    "p_47": "Remember, the opening and closing sentences in these templates are often optional. If they don’t feel necessary for a particular response, it’s perfectly fine to omit them. This can help your answer feel more natural and tailored to the specific question.",
    "p_48": "Lastly, while templates can be helpful guides, try not to rely on them too heavily. The goal is to develop your own skills in formulating responses. Use the templates as a starting point, but practice putting things in your own words and developing your unique voice. This will make your answers more authentic and demonstrate your true understanding of the material.",
    "h2_9": "Sample Questions and Answers",
    "p_49": "Alright, now let’s use these template sentences to complete the summary writing part based on the previous conversation content. You can pause here to practice using the template for writing.",
    "p_50": "Welcome back. Let’s look at the sample answer. You can take a screenshot to save this answer.",

    "p_54": "Now, let’s look at a sample question of the Classroom Content/Academic Question Type. Before that, please practice this sample question first by using  this link: <a href='https://englishtest.duolingo.com/sample-question?type=aic&amp;scenario=student-professor' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>https://englishtest.duolingo.com/sample-question?type=aic&amp;scenario=student-professor</a>",
    "p_55": "First, let’s examine the scenario part.",
    "gray3": "Interactive Listening Demo Scenario 2",
    "p_56": "There are some key pieces of information here. Firstly, it introduces the characters and their identities in the dialogue, namely a student and a professor. Your problem is that you don’t fully understand the term, ‘cultivate sources’, so you want to ask the professor for further explanation.",
    "p_57": "Alright, after analyzing the scenario, let’s look at Part 1. Notice that in this question, we don’t start with the audio part, but with making a choice. This is the same in the actual exam; the order is not fixed. You might first hear an audio clip, or you might need to make a choice first.",
    "p_58": "Let’s look at the first question. When choosing, we can refer to the scenario and compare. Through comparison, we find that option 4 matches the description in the scenario, so it’s correct.",
    "p_59": "The professor then responds, “Sure. What was it?” asking about your specific question. This isn’t very complicated. We can continue to compare with the scenario and find that the last option is the most fitting, matching the question description in the scenario. So we choose it as the correct answer.",
    "p_60": "The professor then says: “Absolutely. Cultivating sources refers to the process of developing relationships with people who can provide information for stories. This can be done in a number of ways, but some common ones are attending events that potential sources are likely to be attending, initiating conversations, or asking current sources for additional people they may know.” This answer is long, but essentially, the professor is explaining what ‘Cultivating sources’ means and how to do it.",
    "p_61": "How would you respond? Let’s look at the options. The options in this question are relatively simple, but we can’t refer to the scenario anymore. We need to analyze each option. First, ‘earn extra credit’ wasn’t mentioned in the conversation, so we can rule it out. The second option, asking about a story, wasn’t mentioned either. Similarly, ‘I guess’ and the last option about scheduling a meeting time don’t match the conversation. So, we choose option 3, asking about the comparison with networking, as the correct option.",
    "p_62": "Next, the professor says: ‘In a way, yes. But unlike traditional networking where the goal is to meet as many people as possible, the goal with cultivating sources is to develop deeper relationships with key people who can provide you with information that you need about a topic.’ This explains the similarities and differences between cultivating sources and networking.",
    "p_63": "Then, we need to continue analyzing the options. The first option, ‘solar energy,’ wasn’t mentioned. The third option, ‘interested in both fields,’ also wasn’t mentioned. The last two options, ‘two modes of transportation’ and ‘study group,’ are also unmentioned content, so they can be eliminated. Therefore, the second option is the correct one. Here, you asked the professor about the importance of these relationships.",
    "p_64": "So, the professor should explain why it’s important. The professor continues: ‘It makes your job as a reporter more efficient. Instead of having to call strangers for information or contact public relations departments, you can reach out to your sources and get the information that you need quickly and easily.’",
    "p_65": "At this point, the professor should have answered all your questions, and we should express gratitude. So for the last question, we can choose the fourth option as the correct answer.",
    "p_66": "With this, we’ve completed Part 1.",
    "p_67": "Before we do Part 2, let’s learn two writing templates for the Classroom Content/Academic Question Type. You can pause the video and screenshot these templates to save them.",

Before answering this question, we have 20 seconds to observe the image, please use this time wisely. In addition, we only have one chance to answer. After we start recording, there is no way to pause or cancel and re-record.

    "h24": "People Category Questions",
    "p9": "First, let’s look at the people category of Speak about the Photo questions.",
    "p10": "Check the steps for answering people category questions: ",
    "p11": "1. We can start with the overall scene: Begin by describing the background or setting of the image. Mention whether it’s an indoor or outdoor scene, the time of day, and any relevant colors or features. For example, we can say: “The picture shows a group of people gathered in a lush, green park on a sunny afternoon.” ",
    "p12": "2. Then, we can describe the people: Talk about how many people are in the picture, their ages, genders, and any notable characteristics such as clothing, hairstyles, or accessories. For example: “There are five people in the picture, including two women, two men, and a young child. The women are wearing summer dresses and wide-brimmed hats, while the men are dressed in casual shirts and pants. The child is wearing a bright red shirt and shorts.” ",
    "p13": "3. In the third step, we can mention their positions and postures: Explain how the people are arranged in the frame and describe their body language and what actions they’re performing. For example, we can say: “The two women are sitting on a picnic blanket, chatting and laughing, while one of the men is standing nearby with a camera, taking a photo. The other man is playfully chasing the child, who is running with a big smile on their face.” ",
    "p14": "4. In the fourth step, we can discuss facial expressions and emotions: Describe the expressions on people’s faces and the emotions they seem to be feeling. For example: “Everyone in the picture looks happy and relaxed. The women have warm smiles on their faces as they talk, and the man with the camera has a look of concentration mixed with amusement. The child’s face is full of joy and excitement.” ",
    "p15": "5. Then in the fifth step, we can discuss any other details: Mention any other elements in the image, such as objects, animals, or other people in the background, which can add to the overall atmosphere or story. Like: “In the background, we can see other park-goers enjoying the day, including a couple walking their dog and a group of friends playing frisbee.” ",
    "p16": "6. In the sixth step, we can summarize the overall impression: Finally, sum up the general mood or theme conveyed by the image. Such as: “This picture captures a joyful and carefree summer day spent with friends and family in a beautiful park setting.” ",
    "p17": "7. In the last step, we can use our imagination and personal experiences: Connect similar scenes or events that have happened to you to expand your answer and extend your speaking time. This method can be used to provide a more comprehensive response. For example: “The picture reminds me of a family picnic we had last summer at a nearby park. Just like in the photo, we spent the day laughing, playing games, and enjoying each other’s company. The atmosphere was so warm and joyful, and it’s a memory I’ll always cherish.” ",

    "p22": "One difficulty with image questions is that they are not easy to organize answers for, because we don’t have any prompts to help us answer. But actually, during practice, we can ask ourselves questions around the image, like the following ones: ",
    "ul5": {

    "p24": "Well, from this picture, I can see that there is a kid who has curly blonde hair. In this step, we describe the number and appearance of people in the image. Then we can say, she is prostrating on the grass and blowing a dry dandelion flower with rapt attention, to describe the actions and behaviors of the person in the image. We can see that she is wearing a white sleeveless top, so we can predict that the weather is mild. In this step, we mention the person’s clothing and the weather. I guess this adorable kid could be a kindergarten student, and she doesn’t have much coursework to do every day. So, she could have enough spare time playing outside. Here we make reasonable guesses and associations about the background of the photo.",
    "p25": "That reminds me of my childhood. When I was a kid, I liked to play in a park in my neighborhood. There are beautiful gardens, and an open grassland just like the one in this picture. My friends and I have taken numerous photos in the park, and it was fun to play out in nature. In this step, we can relate to some of our own life experiences. Here we must note that when doing Speak about the Photo questions, we cannot start with associations and imagination right away. We must first objectively describe the image to ensure the relevance of the answer.",
    "p26": "At the end of the answer, if we still have time, we can comment on the image itself. For example, we can say Personally, I think playing out in nature has numbers of benefits. For instance, outdoor play encourages children to run, jump, skip, climb, and be active, helping people to stay fit and healthy. Besides, nature provides an environment that encourages exploration and discovery, which can reduce stress and improve mood. And I believe the kid in this picture will benefit a lot from playing out in nature. At this point, we have completely answered the sample question.",

In the first step, describe the people in the image, such as the number of people, gender, age, appearance, posture, actions, facial expressions, occupation, identity, etc. Next, we can describe the background in the image, such as the environment, background objects, weather, other people and things in the background, etc. Finally, we can expand on associations, such as background stories related to the image, personal experiences, etc. In this way, we complete the answer to this question.

    "h22": "Overview of ‘Read, Then Speak’ Questions",
    "p4": "Let’s start by looking at an overview of these question types. First up is the ‘Read, then speak’ format. It’s classified as an Oral Response Question, which means you’ll be expected to provide a spoken answer. You’ll need to formulate and articulate your thoughts verbally.",
    "p5": "Now, how often will you see this type of question? It appears once per session. This means you should be prepared for it, but don’t worry about facing multiple instances of this question type.",
    "p6": "Let’s move on to some key tips for tackling this question effectively:",
    "p7": "1. Answer clearly and naturally: This is crucial. You want to sound confident and comfortable, not like you’re reciting memorized text. Speak as if you’re having a conversation with someone.",
    "p8": "2. Use a variety of vocabulary and sentence structures: This is your chance to showcase your language skills. Don’t stick to simple sentences or basic words. Demonstrate the breadth of your English knowledge by incorporating diverse vocabulary and constructing complex sentences where appropriate.",
    "p9": "3. Ensure fluency: The goal here is to speak smoothly without too many pauses or hesitations. Practice is key to improving your fluency. The more comfortable you are with speaking English, the more natural your response will sound.",
    "p10": "4. Pay attention to pronunciation and intonation: It’s not just about what you say, but how you say it. Clear pronunciation helps ensure you’re understood, while proper intonation can convey meaning and emotion, making your speech more engaging and natural-sounding.",
    "h23": "Overview of ‘Listen, Then Speak’ Questions",
    "p11": "Next, let’s move on to discussing the Listen, Then Speak question type. This is another crucial component of the Duolingo English Test that you’ll need to prepare for.",
    "p12": "The format for this question is an Oral Response to the Heard Question. This means you’ll be listening to a prompt or question and then responding verbally. It’s important to note that this type of question appears twice per session, so you’ll have multiple opportunities to showcase your listening comprehension and speaking skills.",
    "p13": "Now, let’s go through some essential tips for succeeding in this part of the test:",
    "p14": "1. Answer clearly and naturally: Just like in the previous question type, it’s vital to speak in a clear, confident manner. Aim for a natural conversational tone rather than sounding rehearsed.",
    "p15": "2. Use a variety of vocabulary and sentence structures: This is your chance to demonstrate the breadth of your English language skills. Don’t shy away from using more advanced vocabulary or complex sentence structures if they fit the context of your response.",
    "p16": "3. Ensure fluency: Strive for smooth, continuous speech. Practice speaking on various topics to improve your ability to articulate your thoughts without frequent pauses or hesitations.",
    "p17": "4. Pay attention to pronunciation and intonation: Clear pronunciation is crucial for being understood, while proper intonation can help convey your message more effectively and naturally.",
    "p18": "5. Make sure you understand the question and ensure your response is relevant: This tip is specific to the Listen, Then Speak format. It’s critical that you listen carefully to the question or prompt and respond appropriately. Your answer should directly address what you’ve heard.",
    "p19": "Remember, this question type is testing not only your speaking abilities but also your listening comprehension. It’s a more complex task as you need to process auditory information and then formulate a relevant spoken response. ",
    "p20": "Practicing active listening skills alongside your speaking practice will be key to excelling in this part of the test. Try to expose yourself to various English accents and speaking speeds to prepare for different possibilities in the actual test.",
    "h24": "Scoring Criteria for Speaking Tasks",
    "p21": "Now that we’ve gone over the question types, let’s dive into the scoring criteria. The two speaking tasks we just discussed fall under the open-response question types. For the Duolingo English Test, speaking is evaluated across six dimensions, which we’ve highlighted with red boxes. Next, we’ll go through each of these dimensions one by one.",
    "p22": "First, let’s look at content. This dimension evaluates the relevance, style, development, and effect on the reader of your response. It’s crucial to ensure that your answer directly addresses the prompt and is well-developed with appropriate style.",
    "p23": "The second dimension is discourse coherence, which applies to writing questions only. However, it’s worth noting that clarity, cohesion, progression of ideas, and structure are important in spoken responses as well, even if they’re not formally evaluated in the same way.",
    "p24": "Third, we have lexis, or vocabulary. For speaking tasks, the grading engine will assess your lexical diversity, sophistication, and choice of words. While spelling isn’t applicable to speaking, using a rich and appropriate vocabulary is key.",
    "p25": "Fourth is grammar. In speaking tasks, the system will evaluate your grammatical complexity and accuracy. Although punctuation isn’t relevant for speaking, using correct grammar in your oral responses is crucial.",
    "p26": "The fifth dimension, which is specific to speaking questions, is fluency. This includes your speed of delivery, natural use of pauses, and how much you rely on filler words, repetition, or false starts and stops. The goal is to speak smoothly and naturally.",
    "p27": "Lastly, we have pronunciation, another speaking-specific criterion. This covers intelligibility, individual sounds, word stress, sentence stress, and intonation. Clear pronunciation is essential for effective communication.",
    "p28": "Remember, the AI grading engine is designed to understand your English proficiency just like expert human raters would. It’s looking at these various aspects to form a comprehensive assessment of your speaking skills. By focusing on improving in each of these areas, you can boost your performance on the speaking sections of the Duolingo English Test.",
    "h25": "Categories of Speaking Questions",
    "p29": "Having covered the scoring criteria, let’s take a look at the question categories for the ‘Read, Then Speak’ and ‘Listen, Then Speak’ speaking tasks.",
    "img2": "A screenshot of DET Speaking Question Categories.",
    "figcaption1": "DET Speaking Question Categories",
    "p30": "As we can see, there are 3 main categories of questions you might encounter:",
    "p31": "1. Descriptive Questions: These questions typically ask you to describe something in detail. This could be a person, place, object, or even a process. When answering these questions, your goal is to provide a clear, vivid picture using your words. You’ll want to use specific details and sensory language to make your description come alive.",
    "p32": "2. Argumentative/Opinion/Discussion Questions: This category is quite broad and includes questions that ask for your personal views or require you to make an argument. You might be asked to discuss a controversial topic, defend a position, or explain why you agree or disagree with a statement. The key here is to clearly state your opinion and support it with logical reasoning and relevant examples.",
    "p33": "3. Comparative Questions: These questions will ask you to compare and contrast two or more things. This could be anything from comparing two cities to contrasting different educational systems. When answering these questions, it’s important to highlight both similarities and differences, and organize your response in a clear, logical manner.",
    "p34": "For both the ‘Read, Then Speak’ and ‘Listen, Then Speak’ tasks, you could encounter questions from any of these categories. The main difference is in how the question is presented to you – either in written form that you read, or spoken form that you listen to.",
    "p35": "Remember, regardless of the category, your response should always be relevant to the question asked. Pay attention to the specific wording of the prompt and make sure you’re addressing all parts of the question. ",
    "h26": "Mastering Descriptive Questions",
    "p36": "Next, we’ll go through each of these question categories one by one, starting with Descriptive Questions. Let’s first take a look at some sample question examples:",
    "ol2": "Describe a famous work of art.",
    "p37": "•What kind of art is it?",
    "p38": "•What does it mean to you?What do you know about the artist",

    "p44": "•Where do you go to apply for a license?",
    "p45": "•What exams are involved?",
    "p46": "•What documents are required?",
    "p47": "4. <strong>Talk about something that annoys you.</strong>",
    "p48": "•Why does it annoy you?",
    "p49": "•How do you react when someone does this?",
    "p50": "•Do you think this annoys others as well?",
    "p51": "These questions require you to use descriptive language, provide specific details, and organize your thoughts clearly. They test your ability to recall and articulate visual and experiential information.",
    "p52": "Now, we’ll take a sample question and discuss a very important feature of these types of questions, which is closely related to the approach we’ll be using. The question is: Talk about something that annoys you. Why does it annoy you? How do you react when someone does this? Do you think this annoys others as well?",
    "img3": "A diagram shows the structure of DET speaking questions.",
    "figcaption2": "DET Speaking Questions Structure",
    "p53": "As we can see, this question can be divided into two parts. The first part is the speaking prompt or the topic, and the second part consists of specific questions. This is a very common structure in this type of question, where you have a topic followed by a series of questions.",
    "p54": "Based on the characteristics of this type of question, we can design a versatile opening sentence to help us start our response. The sentence is:",
    "p55": "Versatile Opening Sentence:",
    "p56": "<span class=\"blue-text\">Well, for this topic, I would like to</span> <span class=\"red-text\">+ content of the topic (modify pronouns)</span>",
    "p57": "Remember to modify pronouns when answering. For the sample question we mentioned earlier, we could structure the response like this: Well, for this topic, I would like to talk about something that annoys me. Notice how we changed ‘annoys you’ to ‘annoys me’ from the original prompt, making sure to adjust the pronouns accordingly. This approach allows us to create a smoother opening sentence. A strong start can reduce the pressure during the exam. If speaking is a weaker area for you, we recommend using this strategy to structure your responses.",
    "p58": "Next, let’s learn a Descriptive Answer Template. Pay attention to how this template includes the versatile opening sentence we just discussed. As with all our previous videos, we use two different colors to highlight the template sentences: blue for the fixed parts and red for the sections you can freely replace with relevant content depending on the question.",
    "p59": "Descriptive Answer Template:",

    "p65": "<span class=\"blue-text\">One experience that stands out in my memory is when</span> I was constantly interrupted during a presentation. <span class=\"blue-text\">This happened</span> a few months ago during a meeting <span class=\"blue-text\">at</span> my workplace. <span class=\"blue-text\">I was</span> presenting a crucial project update when a colleague repeatedly cut me off to make unnecessary comments. <span class=\"blue-text\">The reason why this experience is significant to me is because</span> it made me realize how much I value respect and active listening in a professional setting.

I reacted by politely asking my colleague to hold his questions and comments until the end of the presentation. I believe this kind of behavior can annoy others as well, as everyone deserves to be heard without interruption. <span class=\"blue-text\">Overall, this experience</span> taught me the importance of setting boundaries and promoting a respectful communication culture.",
    "p66": "First, we can start by saying: *One experience that stands out in my memory is when I was constantly interrupted during a presentation.* This provides a brief description of the event or situation. Next, we can say: *This happened a few months ago during a meeting at my workplace.* This helps to mention when and where the event occurred. Then, we continue with: *I was presenting a crucial project update when a colleague repeatedly cut me off to make unnecessary comments.* This allows us to mention the details of the event.",
    "p67": "Following this, we can say: *The reason why this experience is significant to me is because it made me realize how much I value respect and active listening in a professional setting. Being interrupted not only disrupts the flow of thoughts but also conveys a lack of respect for the speaker.* This part addresses why the event is significant or had a major impact. ",
    "p68": "Afterward, we can say: *Looking back, I feel frustrated yet motivated to address such situations more assertively. I reacted by politely asking my colleague to hold his questions and comments until the end of the presentation. I believe this kind of behavior can annoy others as well, as everyone deserves to be heard without interruption.* This helps to express your feelings or thoughts.",
    "p69": "Finally, we can conclude with: *Overall, this experience taught me the importance of setting boundaries and promoting a respectful communication culture.* This serves as a post-event summary or review. With this approach, we have a complete and coherent response.",
    "p70": "Similarly, we offer an advanced template with upgraded vocabulary for you to use. Keep in mind that for speaking tasks, the complexity of vocabulary is not a mandatory requirement for achieving a high score. For example, compared to fluency and content relevance, vocabulary complexity has a weaker impact on your score. We recommend this template for test-takers with a solid foundation in English who want to enhance their responses with more complex vocabulary. In other words, if your score requirement isn’t very high, you can stick to using the standard template for answering. Feel free to take a screenshot to save this template for future use.",

    "h22": "Introduction to ‘Read Aloud’ Questions",
    "p10": "Hello everyone. Welcome to the Duolingo English Test Prep Hub. Today we will explain the ‘Read Aloud’ question type. The format of ‘Read Aloud’ questions is very simple, just like the image shown on the right. There is a sentence here in quotation marks, which is an English sentence. We just need to read it out loud. When actually doing the test, we can click on “record now” to start recording. This question type appears 3 to 6 times per test, so remember this frequency.",
    "p11": "A few tips should keep in mind:",
    "p12": "First of all, when doing this type of question, pay attention to your volume. Try to speak a bit louder and pronounce clearly, because as we know, the Duolingo test is an AI-scored test, meaning artificial intelligence is grading it. So if your volume is louder and pronunciation is clearer, it will help the AI recognize the words you are saying.",
    "p13": "As for speaking speed, you don’t need to speak particularly fast for this question type. Just read it out naturally. What else should we pay attention to? Before recording, if you encounter some unfamiliar words, you can quietly practice reading them once before actually clicking “record now”. But pay attention to the time limit. Including the time to read the question and record, you only have 20 seconds total.",
    "p14": "So after seeing this question, don’t linger too long, otherwise, it may lead to a situation where time is up but you haven’t finished the question. Also, pay attention to pausing properly.",
    "p15": "Although this is a reading-aloud question, if your pronunciation is more natural and intonation is richer, it will help improve the score for this question. Also, try to ensure fluency as much as possible. Don’t have long pauses or hesitations like “um” or “ah” in the middle of reading, as this will also affect the question score. Okay, these are some things to pay attention to for the Read Aloud questions. ",
    "h23": "Understanding the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)",
    "p16": "Next, let’s start with the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and familiarize ourselves with it. We won’t go through all the easily confused pronunciations, just some of the more representative ones.",
    "img2": "A diagram shows International Phonetic Alphabet.",
    "p17": "The parts with a gray background are called “vowels”, and the parts with a light yellow background are called “consonants”, very simple. Now let’s take a look. For example, the group of long vowels in the orange box is relatively easy to pronounce, but you need to make the sound a bit longer.",
    "p18": "So, this word is also very simple, it’s “sheep”. The one behind it without the two dots is a short vowel. The mouth shape is especially small, just pronounce it like this  “ih-” sound. The mouth shape doesn’t need to be particularly big. So this word is pronounced as “ship”. Don’t read it as “sheep”, that’s incorrect. Pay attention to the difference in pronunciation. ",
    "p19": "There’s also the group below. How should this long and short “u” vowel be pronounced? How to read the one in front without the two dots? Your mouth is half open, and try to find that feeling of singing, the feeling of contracting your abdomen. Meaning your belly pulls in a little, it’s a very short sound. You don’t need to purse your lips forward.",
    "p20": "Remember, so this word is pronounced as “guhd”, just like that. Don’t read it as “goood”, that would be wrong. Only purse your lips when pronouncing the long vowel /u:/ with the two dots. So this word is pronounced as “shoot”. Pay attention to the difference between the long and short vowels.",
    "p21": "Okay, let’s look at the group below. What’s the difference in this group? One is a small mouth sound, “eh”, very short. The mouth shape doesn’t need to open that wide, so this word is just pronounced as “bet”. The one below is called a big mouth sound. The mouth opens very wide, feeling like it’s already pressing against the vocal cords. Then it’s pronounced as “kat”, like that. Note that this sound shouldn’t be mixed with the /ai/ sound behind it, so it’s pronounced as “my”. So I hear a lot of people pronounce “bad” as “bide”, which is incorrect. Pay attention to the difference in their pronunciation.",
    "p22": "Are there any other easily confused sounds? It’s just these two. One is /v/. When making this sound, pay attention that your upper teeth should touch your lower lip. So this word is pronounced as “video”. I hear many students pronounce “video” as “waydeo” or pronounce “very” as “wary”. ",
    "p23": "When making this sound, you need to purse your lips forward a bit. So this word is pronounced as “wet”.",
    "p24": "There’s also the pronunciation of this IPA symbol that looks like an “L”. In the word here, we can see that this simple word is “love”. So it can be pronounced as /l/, but for example in the word “help”. What is the pronunciation of this word then? Let’s look at the pronunciation of this word first, it’s “help”, pronounced like this, right? So we wouldn’t read it as “helop”. So how is this sound made? It’s actually very simple. We use our tongue to curl up and press against the back of the upper teeth. Try to make the “o” sound, which is the sound we just made. So it’s “help”. Are there other words? Like “school”, “child”, they also have this pronunciation. Okay, these are the common easily confused sounds we talked about.",
    "h24": "Word Stress and Its Importance",
    "p25": "Next, let’s look at some pronunciation techniques or things to pay attention to. First, we will explain what “word stress” means. It has the meaning of pressure, referring to the stressed syllable here. So “word stress” is very simple, we can understand it as the stressed syllable in a word. Let’s look at the explanation: “In words with more than one syllable, we pronounce one syllable longer and louder when speaking. The one syllable receives word stress.” ",
    "p26": "First of all, in words with more than one syllable, we pronounce one syllable a bit longer and louder. That syllable is where the word stress is. Why is word stress important? Let’s take a look: “It is important to stress the correct syllable so that you can be understood.” In other words, we need to stress the correct syllable in a word for others to understand what we are saying.",
    "p27": "Okay, then let’s do a simple little test. Let’s take a look, there are a total of three small questions. It asks how many syllables are in the word in quotation marks, and which syllable has the stress we mentioned. If you have paper and pen in front of the screen, we can write down the word on paper and mark the stress symbol in a position.",
    "p28": "<strong><em><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">Answer the following questions:</mark></em></strong>",
    "p29": "<mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">1.How many syllables are there in the word “interesting”?</mark>",
    "p30": "<mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">2. Which syllable has the word stress?</mark>",
    "p31": "<mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">3. Put “ ’ ” before the stressed syllable in the word.</mark>",
    "p32": "Okay, let’s look at the answer. The word “in/teres/ting” has three syllables. And which syllable has the stress? It’s the one at the very front. So this word is called “‘interesting”, don’t read it as “in’teresting”, that would be incorrect.",
    "p33": "Okay, let’s look at more practice. You can pause here and try to mark the stress symbols on all these words.",
    "p34": "Okay, let’s look at the answer to this question.",
    "p35": "If the stress positions you marked are different from the ones above, it is recommended to check the dictionary again and listen to how it is pronounced. These are the pronunciations of the words we mentioned. Let’s see how they should be read in sentences. ",
    "p36": "Okay, there are five sentences here. We can pause here, and then try to read these five sentences one by one.",
    "p37": "<mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">1. It’s important to participate in campus events, especially for new students.</mark>",
    "p38": "<mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">2. The people who attend art fairs and music events are usually very welcoming.</mark>",
    "p39": "<mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">3. Universities should provide students with opportunities to showcase their skills.</mark>",
    "p40": "<mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">4. Recently, universities have been organizing more campus activities, as more students want to be involved in their campus communities.</mark>",
    "p41": "<mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">5. More universities have recognized the importance of art-centered events.</mark>",
    "p42": "Then we can compare with the demonstration. Now you can pause to read aloud. Okay, welcome back. Let’s see how these sentences should be read.",
    "p43": "These are the pronunciations of the sentences we talked about.",
    "h25": "Sentence Stress and Emphasis",
    "p44": "Next, let’s talk about how to show important information when we are speaking. This will involve sentence stress. So how is this explained? Let’s take a look. When speaking, we pronounce certain words louder, longer, and in a higher voice to show new, or important information. ",
    "p45": "Okay, let’s look at an example. This is actually very simple, a small dialogue. The person below speaks first, he says “How’s your day been so far?” Meaning, up until now when I see you, how has your day been? How does Jeremy respond? Well, “It’s been <strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">pretty eventful</mark></strong>.” Here “pretty eventful” is pronounced longer to show what? New information. Then he says another sentence, “For me, it’s good to <strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">try new things</mark></strong>.” Here “try new things” is stretched out a bit to show important information. Okay, we can do a small exercise.",
    "p46": "In actual sentences, how do we emphasize a certain part? For example, like this sentence: “I really appreciate all the trouble you’ve gone to.”, we can stress the words marked in red, and then do an emphasis. How to read it? We can read it this way: I <mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\"><strong>really</strong></mark> appreciate <strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">all</mark></strong> the trouble you’ve gone to.",
    "p47": "This way, it’s much better when speaking, because you are doing an emphasis, appreciating this person. Then let’s look at the next sentence. You can try reading it. Stress the words in red, do an emphasis:",
    "p48": "If you need <strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">help</mark></strong> getting another job, <strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">I’ll</mark></strong> help you with that.",
    "p49": "Okay, let’s look at the next sentence. How should this sentence be read? We see that it emphasizes these number-related phrases. We can read it like this:",
    "p50": "This is put together as<strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\"> 3 phrases</mark></strong> or sections, each being <strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">4 bars long</mark></strong>.",
    "p51": "You can try it out. Okay, how should this sentence be read? We can say:",
    "p52": "As <strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">urban</mark></strong> cultures and societies developed, there was<strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\"> a proliferation</mark></strong> in the forms of literature.",
    "p53": "That’s it. Let’s look at this sentence, you can also pause this video and try reading it. Okay, how should this sentence be read?",
    "p54": "<strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">Infections</mark></strong> can often <strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">be cured</mark></strong> by antibiotics, though <strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">resistance</mark></strong> to antibiotics is a problem.",
    "p55": "For the next sentence, we can emphasize the words in red.",
    "p56": "This <strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">syndrome</mark></strong> is characterized by <strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">rapid rhythmic movements</mark></strong> of <strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">lips</mark></strong> so that it resembles a rabbit chewing.",
    "h26": "Advanced Pronunciation Techniques",
    "h31": "Linking",
    "p57": "Now let’s look at another important pronunciation technique, or a language phenomenon that can also be found in a lot of listening and other people’s dialogues, called “linking”. The word “link” itself means to connect. So we call it “linking”. There are some rules for linking. For example, the most common type is when the end of a word is a consonant, followed by a word beginning with a vowel, we need to read these two words together. For example, the group below:",
    "img3": "DET pronunciation tech 1: linking words group",
    "p58": "This is what we mean by linking the consonant at the end of a word with the vowel of the next word.",
    "h32": "Assimilation",
    "p59": "Are there any others? There are also some assimilation phenomena, for example, when /t/ is linked with /j/, it should change to the sound /ʧ/; when /d/ is linked with /j/, it should change to the sound /ʤ/. Examples include:",
    "p60": "e.g.: nex<strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">t_y</mark></strong>ear,  di<strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">d_y</mark></strong>ou",
    "p61": "There is also /r/ sound linking, for example, “her own”, we can read it as “he r-own”. Also, “answer r-it”, “the idea rof”, we can read it like this.",
    "p62": "Okay, let’s look at the fourth point, vowel linking.",
    "p63": " – When a word ending in <span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\">/u/</span>, <span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\">/au/</span>, or <span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\">/o/</span> is followed by a word starting with a vowel, insert a light <span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\">/w/</span> sound between the vowels.",
    "p64": " e.g: <span style=\"color: red; text-decoration: underline;\">go on</span>, <span style=\"color: red; text-decoration: underline;\">who else</span>, <span style=\"color: red; text-decoration: underline;\">you are</span>",
    "p65": " – When a word ending in <span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\">/i/</span>, <span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\">/ai/</span>, or <span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\">/e/</span> is followed by a word starting with a vowel, insert a light <span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\">/j/</span> sound between the vowels.",
    "p66": " e.g: <span style=\"color: red; text-decoration: underline;\">be on</span> time, <span style=\"color: red; text-decoration: underline;\">my only</span> child",
    "p67": "Also, ending in /i/, /ai/, /e/ and linking with the vowel that follows, then add a weaker /j/ between the two vowels. For example, “be on time”, “my only child”. Okay, then there is consonant elision. Remember when we encounter these six phonetic symbols, which are /b/, /p/, /t/, /d/, /k/, /g/, when any two of them appear consecutively, the first one is not pronounced. For example, we see /t/ and /d/ appear consecutively, so the first one is directly omitted, read as “si<strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">t</mark></strong> down” (note the letter in red is omiited). Similar examples include: “nex<strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">t</mark></strong> day”, “a goo<strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">d</mark></strong> deal”, “a ba<strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">d</mark></strong> cold”, “wha<strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">t</mark></strong> time”, “bi<strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">g</mark></strong> boy”.",
    "h33": "Consonant elision and merging",
    "p68": "Next is consonant merging. If two consonants are the same, we can omit one of them. For example, “fre<strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">sh</mark></strong> shrimp”, and “wat<mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\"><strong>ch</strong></mark> chain”.",
    "h34": "Weak forms",
    "p69": "There is another phonetic rule called “weak forms”. Weak forms refer to those word endings. If it is a voiceless consonant, meaning those consonants produced without vibration of the vocal cords, we call them voiceless consonants, they can be weakly pronounced. Also, those function words, meaning words other than nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, we can sometimes pronounce them weakly. For example, let’s give some examples. Here:",
    "p70": "There are also hundred<strong>s_o</strong>f other sculpture<strong>s_a</strong>n<strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">d</mark></strong> pictures.",
    "p71": "The /d/ after “and” here can be omitted, we can directly read it as “n”, just like the pronunciation of the letter “n”. Also, for example, we say “you n me”, “bread n butter”, and rock is called “rock n roll”, right? We don’t say “rock and roll”.",
    "h27": "Practice Sentences and Application",
    "p72": "Let’s look at the sentence below:",
    "p73": "I<strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">t</mark></strong> does no<strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">t</mark></strong> rus<strong>t_i</strong>n the air, though.",
    "p74": "We see that the endings of some words are voiceless consonants. They are all voiceless consonants. How to read it? We can say “It does not rust in the air, though.” The two /t/ sounds here are directly omitted, swallowed. There is only a mouth shape, but no airflow and no sound coming out. Okay, let’s look at the sentence below:",

Today, we’re going to walk through the “Duolingo English Test Comprehensive Prep Course” with a special focus on speaking samples. So, grab your notebooks and let’s get started!",
    "p14": "Alright, first things first. Our course today is the “Duolingo English Test Comprehensive Advancement Course.” This is a fantastic resource for anyone looking to ace their Duolingo English Test, especially the speaking section. It’s presented by DETPractice.com, your go to site for all things Duolingo English Test.",

    "p16": "Now, some quick tips:",
    "img2": "Tips and introduction to DET speaking sample questions.",
    "figcaption1": "Speaking Sample Questions Quick Tips",
    "p17": "1. Answer clearly and naturally. Speak in a clear, conversational tone as if you’re talking to a friend. Don’t try to force complex words or structures if they don’t come naturally to you. Focus on expressing your ideas coherently and confidently. Remember, the goal is to demonstrate your English proficiency, not to impress with overly complicated language.",
    "p18": "2. Use a variety of vocabulary and sentence structures. Showcase your language skills by incorporating diverse vocabulary and sentence patterns. Mix short and long sentences, and use both simple and complex structures. For example, combine statements with questions, or use conditional sentences where appropriate. This demonstrates your ability to express ideas in different ways and highlights your command of English.",
    "p19": "3. Keep your fluency in check. Aim for a smooth, steady flow of speech without too many pauses or hesitations. However, don’t sacrifice accuracy for speed. It’s okay to take brief pauses to collect your thoughts, but try to maintain a natural rhythm. Practice speaking on various topics to improve your overall fluency and ability to think on your feet in English.",
    "p20": "4. Pay attention to your pronunciation and intonation. Clear pronunciation is crucial for effective communication. Focus on articulating words clearly, especially those with sounds that might be challenging in your native language. Additionally, use appropriate intonation to convey meaning and emotion. Rising intonation for questions and falling intonation for statements can make your speech more natural and easier to understand.",
    "p21": "Scoring time! The grading engine will evaluate your response on multiple aspects of English proficiency, similar to how expert human raters would assess your performance. Here’s a breakdown of what they’ll be looking at:",
    "img3": "A screeenshot of DET scoring criteria.",
    "figcaption2": "DET Scoring Criteria",
    "p22": "Content: They’ll assess the relevance of your response, your style, how well you develop your ideas, and the overall effect on the reader or listener.  ",
    "p23": "Discourse coherence: For writing questions, they’ll evaluate the clarity of your expression, how well your ideas flow together (cohesion), the logical progression of your thoughts, and the overall structure of your response.",
    "p24": "Vocabulary (lexis): They’ll look at the diversity and sophistication of your vocabulary, your word choices, how you form words, and your spelling (for writing questions).",
    "p25": "Grammar: Your grammatical complexity and accuracy will be assessed, including punctuation for written responses.",
    "p26": "Fluency (for speaking questions): They’ll evaluate your speaking speed, how naturally you use pauses, and whether you rely too much on filler words, repetition, or have trouble starting or stopping.",
    "p27": "Pronunciation (for speaking questions): This includes how intelligible your speech is, your pronunciation of individual sounds, word stress, sentence stress, and intonation.",
    "h24": "Types of Speaking Sample Questions",
    "p28": "Alright, let’s break down the different types of speaking sample questions you might encounter on the Duolingo English Test. We’ve got four main categories to cover:",
    "img4": "Categories  of DET Speaking Sample questions.",
    "figcaption3": "Speaking Sample Categories",
    "p29": "First, we have Descriptive Questions. These are all about painting a picture with your words. You might be asked to describe a person, place, or thing in detail. It’s your chance to show off your vocabulary and ability to create vivid imagery through language.",
    "p30": "Next up are Argumentative, Opinion, or Discussion Questions. These are where you get to flex your critical thinking muscles. You’ll need to present your viewpoint on a topic, back it up with reasons, and maybe even address potential counterarguments. It’s all about expressing your thoughts clearly and persuasively.",
    "p31": "Third on our list are Comparative Questions. Here, you’ll need to examine similarities and differences between two or more things. This could be comparing cultures, technologies, or even abstract concepts. The key is to structure your response logically, highlighting both similarities and contrasts.",
    "p32": "Last but not least, we have Hypothetical Questions. These are the ‘what if’ scenarios that test your imagination and ability to speculate. You might be asked about possible future events or to consider alternative outcomes to past situations. It’s your chance to demonstrate your grasp of conditional language and abstract thinking.",
    "h25": "Descriptive Questions",
    "p33": "Let’s look at some descriptive questions. Here’s a demo question: “<mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#4f0fea\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Name something electronic that you use every day. Why do you use it so frequently? How would your life be different if you gave it up for one week?</mark>” ",
    "p34": "Think about it. I’d talk about my smartphone, because I can’t live without it! Imagine giving it up for a week. I’d be lost… like a penguin in the Sahara! The subsequent questions follow a similar pattern. We can see that they all begin with the word ‘describe,’ asking us to elaborate on various topics. Therefore, these all fall under the category of Descriptive Questions.",
    "p35": "Now, let’s examine how to approach these Descriptive Questions. First, we’ll analyze the question itself, which we refer to as the speaking prompt. We can divide this prompt into two parts: the upper portion, which we can call the ‘topic’ – this is the subject we need to address when responding to the speaking prompt. The lower portion contains several questions, which we can refer to as ‘sub-questions’. When answering descriptive questions, start with a universal opening sentence like, “Well, for this topic, I would like to describe…”. Then, use specific details to flesh out your answer. For instance, in response to this sample question, we could begin by saying: ‘Well, for this topic, I would like to describe the last time that I received tutoring.’ ",
    "img5": "Response approach of DET descriptive questions.",
    "figcaption4": "Response Approach of Descriptive Questions",
    "p36": "Next, let’s learn about the first template for answering Descriptive Questions. Now, let’s look at a fantastic template for description responses. This template is color-coded for easy reference. You’ll see blue text, which represents the fixed structure of the template, and red text, which indicates the parts you’ll need to customize based on the specific question you’re answering.",

    "p45": "This detail resonates with me because I remember the last time, I received tutoring for math. My tutor was very patient and explained the concepts clearly. He also gave me tips on how to solve problems faster and more accurately. Another aspect of tutoring that intrigues me is the interactive learning environment which affects me in the following way: it boosts my confidence and motivation. This detail makes me wonder about how different learning styles can influence academic performance.",
    "p46": "Moreover, I also appreciate the mutual benefit as a distinctive feature of tutoring because it connects to my own situation in this manner: I can use what I learned to help others who struggle with the same subject. For example, I can volunteer as a peer tutor at school or online and share my knowledge and skills with other students.",
    "p47": "Taking into account all these aspects, I can conclude that tutoring is a valuable and rewarding experience that not only improves my own learning but also contributes to the learning of others.

    "p77": "Expanding on that, psychological research also led me to this conclusion because it shows that there is no causal link between media violence and real violence, but rather other factors such as personality, family, and social environment influence one’s behavior. Though I recognize that some people may be more susceptible to media violence or may use it as an excuse for their actions, I maintain my perspective because limiting or censoring media violence does not solve the underlying issue of why people behave violently, as evidenced by the fact that many countries with less violent media have higher rates of crime and homicide.",
    "p78": "Being willing to reconsider, however, I understand that some people may be concerned about the effects of media violence on children or vulnerable groups, which still leaves me feeling sympathetic due to their genuine worries.

Let’s answer the question: I have a strong opinion on whether we have a responsibility to get involved when a stranger is in trouble, and I believe that we do.

    "p113": "Now, let’s try to answer the sample question before using this template:",
    "p114": "Evaluating never showing anger and sometimes showing anger, there are benefits to both worth considering. On one hand, never showing anger appeals to me because it helps me maintain a calm and rational demeanor. I feel this way since I once lost my temper at work and said some things I regretted later, which damaged my reputation and relationships.",
    "p115": "On the other hand, sometimes showing anger also has merit, such as expressing my true feelings and setting boundaries, which matters to me because I value honesty and respect. However, I would choose sometimes showing anger over never showing anger because it is healthier and more authentic. My past experiences with bottling up my emotions confirm this. I used to suppress my anger until it exploded in unhealthy ways, such as binge eating, self-harm, or aggression.",
    "p116": "While reasonable minds can differ, sometimes showing anger beats never showing anger for me because it allows me to release my frustration and communicate my needs. If I expand my thinking, I realize that there are different ways of showing anger, such as constructive or destructive, passive or assertive, verbal or nonverbal, yet I return to sometimes showing anger for the sake of my mental health and well-being.",
    "p117": "Additionally, I think that showing anger can also have positive effects on others, such as making them more aware of their actions, motivating them to change or improve, or strengthening our connection through empathy and understanding. Of course, showing anger should be done in a respectful and appropriate way, without hurting or offending anyone. Therefore, I believe that sometimes showing anger is not only okay, but also necessary and beneficial.  ",
    "h28": "Hypothetical Questions",
    "p118": "That concludes our explanation of comparative questions. Now, let’s move on to the final category of questions: Hypothetical Questions.",
    "img8": "Hypothetical question demos of DET speaking sample .",
    "figcaption7": "Hypothetical Question Demos",
    "p119": "Let’s see the sample question: “Where would you go if you could time travel, and why? Who would you take with you, and what would you want to do while you were there?” Oh, fun! I’d travel to the Roaring Twenties and party with the Great Gatsby. Who’s with me?",
    "h31": "Grammar Spotlight: The Subjunctive Mood",
    "p120": "The other three remaining questions also deal with hypothetical situations, so they all fall under the category of Hypothetical Questions. Before we explain how to answer this type of question, let’s first discuss an important grammar point: the <strong>Subjunctive Mood</strong>.",
    "p121": "The subjunctive mood is a crucial grammatical concept, especially when discussing hypothetical situations. It’s used to describe hypothetical situations, suggestions, wishes, commands, or situations contrary to reality. Understanding and using the subjunctive mood correctly can greatly enhance the quality and sophistication of your responses.",
    "p122": "Let’s break down the common scenarios where the subjunctive mood is used:",
    "p123": "1. Expressing hypothetical or unreal situations, typically using “if” clauses.",
    "p124": "For example: If I were you, I would study hard., If she were rich, she would travel around the world.",
    "p125": "Notice how we use “were” instead of “was” in these sentences, even for singular subjects. This is a key feature of the subjunctive mood.",
    "p126": "2. Expressing wishes or regrets, typically using clauses led by “wish”. For example: I wish I were taller. He wishes he had studied harder.",
    "p127": "Again, note the use of “were” and “had” in these sentences.",
    "p128": "3. Expressing suggestions, requests, commands, or proposals, typically using clauses led by verbs such as suggest, recommend, demand, insist, etc. For example: She suggested that he go to the doctor. They demanded that we be quiet.",
    "p129": "In these cases, we use the base form of the verb rather than the usual conjugated forms.",
    "p130": "When answering hypothetical questions in the Duolingo English Test, using the subjunctive mood correctly can demonstrate your advanced grasp of English grammar. It allows you to express complex ideas about imaginary or contrary-to-fact situations with precision and clarity.",
    "p131": "Remember, mastering the subjunctive mood takes practice. As you prepare for the test, try to incorporate these structures into your responses. This will not only improve your grammar but also allow you to articulate more nuanced and sophisticated ideas when dealing with hypothetical scenarios.",
    "p132": "Now, hypothetical situations can be divided into three types of if clauses:",
    "p133": "Type 1: Situations that are possible in the present or future. For these, we use the present simple or present continuous tense for the condition, and the future simple or imperative for the result. For example:",
    "p134": "If it rains tomorrow, we will stay at home.",
    "p135": "If you need any help, just call me.",
    "p136": "These sentences express real possibilities and are used for likely or probable situations.",
    "p137": "Type 2: Situations that are unreal or impossible in the present. This is where we really start to use the subjunctive mood. We use the past simple tense for the condition, and would, could, might plus base form verb for the result. It’s important to note that the verb “be” in the if clause should always be “were,” regardless of the subject’s person or number. For example:",
    "p138": "If I were you, I would study hard.",
    "p139": "If she had more time, she could travel around the world.",
    "p140": "This type is crucial for the Duolingo English Test, as hypothetical questions often use this type of situation. It allows you to express imaginary scenarios or contrary to fact situations in the present.",
    "p141": "Type 3: Situations that were unreal or impossible in the past. Here, we use the past perfect tense for the condition, and would, could, might plus have plus past participle for the result. For example:",
    "p142": "If he had studied harder, he would have passed the exam.",
    "p143": "If you had told me earlier, I might have helped you.",
    "p144": "This type expresses regrets or hypothetical situations in the past that cannot be changed.",
    "p145": "Understanding and correctly using these three types of if-clauses will greatly enhance your ability to answer hypothetical questions on the Duolingo English Test. They allow you to express a range of imaginary scenarios with precision and sophistication.",
    "p146": "When practicing for the test, try to incorporate all three types into your responses. This will demonstrate your advanced grasp of English grammar and your ability to articulate complex ideas about hypothetical situations.",
    "p147": "Remember, the key to mastering these structures is practice. Try creating your own sentences using each type and pay close attention to the verb forms in both the if clause and the main clause.",

    "p6": "Hello, welcome to the Duolingo English Test Preparation Hub. Today, we’re going to explain a question type called Write about the Photo. Before we dive into the specifics, please note that all the photos used in this lesson are either AI-generated or copyright-free stock photos. ",
    "h23": "Understanding the Scoring Criteria",
    "p7": "Alright, now, before we discuss the question formally, let’s first understand the scoring criteria for the writing section of the Duolingo English Test.",
    "img2": "A screenshot of Det writing scoring criteria.",
    "figcaption1": "Det Writing Scoring Criteria",
    "p8": "Since we’re discussing writing tasks, we can focus directly on the “Open Response Question Types” section. Let’s start with the grammar component: In this area, grammatical accuracy and complexity, along with proper punctuation usage, are key scoring criteria. Moreover, when writing, we should aim to eliminate grammatical and syntactical errors. This includes ensuring subject-verb agreement, where the subject and verb agree in number; using singular and plural forms correctly; applying articles such as “a,” “an,” and “the” appropriately; capitalizing words properly, especially at the beginning of sentences and for proper nouns; spelling all words correctly; and using punctuation marks appropriately.",
    "p9": "Paying attention to these details can make our expression more accurate and clearer and improve the overall quality of our language. You can use longer sentences and complex sentence structures (compound and complex sentences) to achieve a higher score.",
    "p10": "Move on to the content，when composing your response, it’s crucial to stay focused on the topic at hand and maintain relevance throughout. Take the time to develop your ideas thoroughly, providing sufficient detail and explanation to support your points. Employ an engaging writing style that captures and holds the reader’s attention. Your goal should be to create a strong impact on the reader, leaving them with a lasting impression of your message. Finally, ensure that your response is well-crafted and persuasive, using logical arguments, compelling evidence, and a clear structure.",
    "p11": "Then let’s check discourse coherence，Clarity is paramount in effective communication, so ensure your writing is easy to understand for your intended audience. Utilize cohesive devices such as transitional phrases and conjunctions to link your ideas smoothly, creating a seamless flow between sentences and paragraphs. Present your ideas in a logical, progressive order that builds upon each point, leading the reader naturally from one concept to the next. Structure your response with a clear introduction that outlines your main points, a well-organized body that develops these ideas, and a strong conclusion that reinforces your key message. Throughout your response, maintain a consistent flow of thought. ",
    "p12": "In the final part of the scoring criteria, let’s look at lexis, also known as vocabulary. For this section, to enhance the quality of your writing, use a wide variety of words to avoid unnecessary repetition. This can make your text more engaging and dynamic. Incorporate sophisticated vocabulary where appropriate but be careful not to overuse complex terms that might confuse your readers. Select words that precisely convey your intended meaning, as this precision can significantly improve the clarity and impact of your message. Always double-check your spelling to ensure accuracy, as spelling errors can detract from your credibility and distract the reader. Strive for a balance between common and advanced words.",
    "h24": "Write About the Photo Task Instructions",
    "p13": "Now that we’ve covered the scoring criteria, let’s take a look at the instructions for the “write about the photo” task:",
    "img3": "Intro and tips of DET write about the photo questions.",
    "figcaption2": "DET Write about the Photo Intro",
    "p14": "This task appears three times per test and is crucial for assessing your literacy and production skills.",
    "p15": "In this task, you’ll be presented with an image and asked to describe its contents in just one minute. Let’s break down what you need to know:",
    "p16": "First, the format is straightforward – describe what you see in the photo. But here’s the key: you’re not just listing objects. We want you to craft a meaningful description.",
    "p17": "Now, let’s talk strategy. You should aim to write at least one complete sentence. This shows you can form coherent thoughts in English. Pay close attention to your grammar and spelling – these are essential components of your literacy score.",
    "p18": "Punctuation is also critical. Proper use of periods, commas, and other punctuation marks demonstrates your understanding of English writing conventions.",
    "p19": "Here’s a pro tip: don’t be afraid to use your imagination. While you should primarily describe what you see, you can also speculate about the background or context of the photo. This can help you create a more engaging and complete response.",
    "h25": "Overview of Question Categories",
    "p20": "Now, let’s dive into the question categories you’ll encounter in the ‘Write About the Photo’ section. Understanding these categories will help you prepare more effectively and respond more comprehensively.",
    "p21": "The DET Practice exam breaks down into four main categories:",
    "img4": "Categories of the DET Write about the Photo questions.",
    "figcaption3": "Write about the Photo Categories",
    "p22": "<strong>People</strong>: This category focuses on human subjects in the image. You might be asked to describe individuals or groups, their actions, clothing, or expressions. Remember to use descriptive language and pay attention to details like age, gender, and any notable characteristics.",
    "p23": "<strong>Animals</strong>: When presented with images of animals, you’ll need to identify the species, if possible, describe their appearance, and any actions they’re performing. This could include domestic pets, wildlife, or even zoo animals.",
    "p24": "<strong>Scenery</strong>: This category covers landscapes, cityscapes, or any environmental settings. You might need to describe natural features like mountains, beaches, or forests, or urban environments like streets, buildings, or parks. Pay attention to the overall atmosphere and any standout elements in the scene.",
    "p25": "<strong>Objects</strong>: The final category deals with inanimate objects. This could range from everyday items to more unique or complex objects. Focus on describing the object’s appearance, size, color, and potential use or significance in the context of the image.",
    "p26": "In the next section, we’ll look at some specific strategies for tackling each of these question categories effectively.",
    "h26": "Mastering People-Related Questions",
    "p27": "First，”Let’s focus on the people-related questions, which are often the most common in the ‘Write About the Photo’ section. We can break these down into three subcategories:",
    "img5": "DET Write about the Photo Images: People sample pictures.",
    "figcaption4": "Write about the Photo Images: People",
    "p28": "<strong>Facial features, Appearance, and Emotions</strong>: This involves describing a person’s physical characteristics and their emotional state.",
    "p29": "<strong>Environment</strong>: Here, you’ll need to describe the surroundings or context in which the person is situated.",
    "p30": "<strong>Actions and Behavior</strong>: This focuses on what the person is doing in the image.",
    "p31": "Now, let’s go through the steps for answering people-related questions effectively:",
    "p32": "Step 1: Observe the image carefully. Identify basic information about the person, such as their gender, approximate age, possible occupation, clothing, facial expression, and posture. This step is crucial as it forms the foundation of your description.",
    "p33": "Step 2: Use one sentence to summarize the background story of the image or the personality traits of the person. This is where you can make inferences based on what you see. For example, if you see a person in a suit rushing down a city street, you might infer they’re a busy professional heading to an important meeting.",
    "p34": "Step 3: Describe the person’s actions or emotions if they’re visible in the image. This adds depth to your description and shows you can interpret non-verbal cues.",
    "p35": "Now, let’s focus on a specific template for answering people-related questions, particularly those centered on facial features, appearance, and emotions. Remember, while we’ve been discussing speaking, this task actually requires you to write about the photo.",
    "p36": "Answer template for people-related questions (focusing on facial features/appearance/emotions):",

    "p46": "This final sentence allows you to focus specifically on the subject’s eyes and what they might reveal about the person’s emotional state or situation.",
    "p47": "When using this template, remember to vary your word choice and sentence structure to avoid repetition. You don’t need to use all four sentences – choose the ones that best fit the image you’re describing.",
    "p48": "Now, let’s look at some useful vocabulary for describing people in your photo descriptions. This table provides a range of descriptive words categorized by age group and gender. These words will help you add depth and variety to your descriptions.",
    "img6": "DET useful descriptive vocabulary for writing people.",

    "p49": "The table covers different age groups from children to elderly individuals, for both males and females. It offers a rich selection of adjectives to describe appearance and characteristics.",
    "p50": "For example, when describing a young adult male, you might use words like ‘dashing’, ‘rugged’, or ‘debonair’. For a middle-aged female, words like ‘classy’, ‘poised’, or ‘alluring’ could be appropriate. Having these words at your fingertips will help you quickly come up with vivid and varied descriptions during the test.",
    "p51": "Remember, while these words are useful, it’s important to use them appropriately and in context. Always ensure your description accurately reflects what you see in the image.",

    "img7": "A table list many descriptive words of emotions.",
    "figcaption6": "Emotion Word List",
    "p53": "The table covers a wide spectrum of emotions, from joy and excitement to sorrow and depression. ",
    "p54": "Remember, when describing emotions in your photo descriptions, it’s important to base your observations on visible cues such as facial expressions, body language, or the context of the image. Using these descriptive words will add depth and nuance to your writing, helping you create more vivid and engaging descriptions.",
    "p55": "Now, let’s focus on another crucial aspect of describing people in photos: clothing and accessories. This table provides an extensive list of vocabulary related to various items of clothing and accessories.",

    "p60": "In the sample answer, we see: ‘Spotlighted in this photo is an individual with long, flowing brown hair and a gentle smile, her appearance speaking volumes about her warm and approachable personality.’",
    "p61": "This response effectively uses the template while incorporating specific details from the image. It describes the external characteristics (long, flowing brown hair and gentle smile) and makes an inference about the person’s personality (warm and approachable) based on these visual cues.",
    "p62": "When using this template for your own responses, remember to:",
    "ul7": "<li>Identify whether you’re describing an individual or a group.</li><li>Use specific, descriptive language for external characteristics.</li><li>Make reasonable inferences about personality or background based on what you see.</li><li>Use the vocabulary we’ve discussed in previous sections to enrich your description.</li>",
    "p63": "Also, note how the response includes details about the subject’s hair and facial expression. These are key elements in describing a person’s appearance and can often provide insights into their mood or personality.",

    "p68": "Notice how this description adds more detail about the hair length and texture compared to the previous example. It also interprets the smile as ‘warm’ in addition to ‘gentle’, providing a more nuanced description of the person’s expression.",
    "p69": "The inference about the person’s identity as ‘laid-back and approachable’ is drawn from these visual cues, demonstrating how appearance can be used to make reasonable assumptions about personality.",
    "p70": "“Now let’s focus on describing the environment in people-related questions. This is crucial as the setting often provides context for the actions and emotions of the people in the photo. We have two templates to work with:",

    "p215": "“Upon careful observation, the inflatable dolphin toy in the image presents a playful design, with a streamlined shape, vibrant blue color, and smooth texture being remarkably noticeable.

    "h26": "Argumentative Questions",
    "p14": "First, let’s focus on the Argumentative Questions in the Interactive Writing section. When crafting a Duolingo English Test discussion essay, you have two effective templates to choose from:",
    "p15": "DET Discussion Essay Structure:",
    "p16": "Template 1:",
    "p17": "Present a balanced view: “<span class=\"blue\">While some might argue that </span><span class=\"red\">[opposing viewpoint]</span><span class=\"blue\">, I believe that </span><span class=\"red\">[your viewpoint]</span>.”",

    "p25": "Conclude by reinforcing your stance: “<span class=\"blue\">Therefore, </span><span class=\"red\">[restate viewpoint]</span>.”",
    "p26": "Each offers a structured approach to presenting your argument clearly and persuasively.",
    "p27": "Template 1 emphasizes a balanced perspective. You begin by acknowledging an opposing viewpoint, then asserting your own stance. This approach demonstrates your ability to consider multiple angles. You’ll then justify your position with solid reasoning, provide a concrete example to illustrate your point, and conclude by reaffirming your stance while acknowledging the counterargument.",
    "p28": "Template 2 takes a more direct approach. You start by clearly stating your viewpoint, then back it up with a primary reason or rationale. To strengthen your argument, you’ll offer a specific example or piece of evidence. The essay concludes by reinforcing your initial stance, tying everything together.",
    "p29": "Both templates guide you through a logical progression of ideas, ensuring your essay is well-structured and convincing. The choice between them may depend on the specific prompt or your personal writing style. Whichever you choose, these templates provide a solid foundation for articulating your thoughts effectively in the DET discussion essay format.",
    "p30": "Notice that we consistently use two colors to highlight these templates. The blue sections are ready-to-use template sentences, while the red parts can be freely replaced according to the specific question. Feel free to take a screenshot to save these template sentences for future reference.",
    "p31": "Now that we’ve covered these template sentences, let’s look at the following example question:",
    "p32": "<strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">Some think that people are never satisfied with what they have; they always want something more or different. Do you agree or disagree? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer. </mark></strong>",
    "p33": "Here’s how we can approach this question:",
    "p34": "<span class=\"orange\">While some might argue that</span> people are constantly dissatisfied and seeking more, <span class=\"orange\">I believe that</span> contentment is achievable and many individuals are satisfied with what they have. <span class=\"orange\">This is mainly due to</span> the fact that true happiness often stems from non-material aspects of life, such as meaningful relationships, personal growth, and a sense of purpose. When people focus on these elements, they are more likely to feel fulfilled and appreciative of what they already possess. <span class=\"orange\">A notable example is</span> the story of the philosopher Diogenes, who lived a simple life in a barrel and found contentment in his pursuit of wisdom and self-sufficiency. Despite having few material possessions, he was known for his happiness and satisfaction with life. <span class=\"orange\">In conclusion, despite</span> the notion that people are never satisfied, <span class=\"orange\">I believe that</span> contentment is possible when individuals prioritize the non-material aspects of life that bring them true fulfillment. By focusing on personal growth, relationships, and purpose, people can find satisfaction in what they already have.",
    "p35": "This sample answer effectively demonstrates the use of Template 1 from our previous discussion. Let’s break it down:",
    "p36": "The response begins with a balanced view: “While some might argue that people are constantly dissatisfied and seeking more, I believe that contentment is achievable, and many individuals are satisfied with what they have.” This opening acknowledges the opposing viewpoint before presenting the writer’s stance.",
    "p37": "The writer then justifies their position: “This is mainly due to the fact that true happiness often stems from non-material aspects of life, such as meaningful relationships, personal growth, and a sense of purpose.” This explanation provides clear reasons for the writer’s belief in achievable contentment.",
    "p38": "An illustrative example follows: “A notable example is the story of the philosopher Diogenes, who lived a simple life in a barrel and found contentment in his pursuit of wisdom and self-sufficiency.” This historical reference strengthens the argument by providing a concrete instance of finding satisfaction with little.",
    "p39": "Finally, the response concludes by reinforcing the main argument: “In conclusion, despite the notion that people are never satisfied, I believe that contentment is possible when individuals prioritize the non-material aspects of life that bring them true fulfillment.”",
    "p40": "This sample answer demonstrates a well-structured response that effectively uses the template to present a clear, balanced, and well-supported argument.",
    "p41": "Next comes the follow-up question, which is step 2 of the interactive writing section:",
    "p42": "<strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-accent-3-color\">How do personal achievements affect the desire for wanting more? Discuss whether you think that accomplishments can lead to satisfaction or further desire.</mark></strong>",
    "p43": "The follow-up response demonstrates the use of Template 2, providing a nice contrast to the initial answer:",
    "p44": "<span class=\"orange\">I firmly believe that</span> personal achievements can lead to both satisfaction and further desire for success. <span class=\"orange\">One primary reason for this is that</span> accomplishments often provide a sense of fulfillment and boost self-confidence, which can motivate individuals to strive for even greater goals. <span class=\"orange\">For instance,</span> an athlete who wins a championship may feel a strong sense of satisfaction, but this success might also ignite a desire to win more titles and break records. <span class=\"orange\">Therefore,</span> personal achievements can serve as a double-edged sword, bringing both contentment and a renewed hunger for further success.",
    "p45": "Let’s examine how this response builds upon the previous discussion while utilizing a different structure:",
    "p46": "The answer begins with a clear stance: “I firmly believe that personal achievements can lead to both satisfaction and further desire for success.” This direct opening aligns with Template 2’s approach of starting with a strong viewpoint.",
    "p47": "The response then elaborates with a primary reason: “One primary reason for this is that accomplishments often provide a sense of fulfillment and boost self-confidence, which can motivate individuals to strive for even greater goals.” This explanation bridges the concepts of contentment and ambition discussed in the initial response.",
    "p48": "An illustrative example follows: “For instance, an athlete who wins a championship may feel a strong sense of satisfaction, but this success might also ignite a desire to win more titles and break records.” This example effectively demonstrates how achievement can simultaneously satisfy and motivate.",
    "p49": "The conclusion reinforces the initial stance: “Therefore, personal achievements can serve as a double-edged sword, bringing both contentment and a renewed hunger for further success.” This closing statement synthesizes the ideas presented and ties back to the original question about satisfaction and the desire for more.",
    "p50": "This follow-up response complements the initial answer by exploring how personal achievements interact with contentment and ambition. It maintains a cohesive discussion while showcasing a different structural approach, demonstrating versatility in addressing related aspects of the topic.",
    "p51": "Remember, the best way to master these templates is through practice. So, make sure to do plenty of exercises to get comfortable using these template sentences. Again, feel free to pause this video and take screenshots of these sample answers for your reference and study.",
    "p52": "We know that vocabulary complexity is also a key factor in the writing score. Therefore, we’re providing the following Vocabulary Enhanced Version templates. Using these templates can help increase your vocabulary score and boost your overall writing section performance.",

    "p64": "This enhanced version of the DET Discussion Essay Structure focuses on elevating the language and sophistication of responses. ",
    "p65": "In Template 1, more advanced phrasing is now utilized, with the balanced view beginning “Though there are those who advocate for…” to introduce a more formal tone. “Justify your position” becomes “Justify your position with a complex argument,” encouraging more nuanced reasoning. The example introduction changes to “A particularly salient example of this is…” for added emphasis and sophistication, while the conclusion now employs “In summation” and “the weight of evidence suggests” for a more scholarly and measured tone.",
    "p66": "Template 2 also receives a vocabulary boost, starting with “It is incontrovertible that…” for a stronger, more assertive opening. Reasons are introduced as “The primary impetus for this perspective stems from…” adding depth and complexity. Examples are prefaced with “Consider, for instance,” sounding more engaging and thoughtful, and the conclusion uses “Hence” for a more formal tone. These upgrades aim to demonstrate higher language proficiency and critical thinking, encouraging test-takers to use more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures.",
    "p67": " However, it’s crucial to use these advanced phrases naturally and appropriately within the essay context. For test-takers aiming for higher writing scores, such as those targeting 120 points or above, you might want to consider using these template sentences. Feel free to pause this video and take a screenshot to save these templates for future reference.",
    "p68": "Now, let’s take a look at how to effectively use these template sentences. The sample responses in this slide demonstrate how to effectively use the templates for constructing sophisticated discussion essays.",

    "p70": "For the first question, Template 1 is applied. The response begins with “Though there are those who advocate for the idea that people are never satisfied and constantly crave more,” acknowledging the opposing viewpoint. It then states the writer’s position: “my conviction lies firmly in the belief that contentment is attainable.”",
    "p71": "The reasoning is introduced with “This belief originates primarily from,” followed by an explanation about non-material aspects of life leading to fulfillment.",
    "p72": "A detailed example is provided with “A particularly salient example of this is the story of the ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes,” illustrating the point about finding contentment through non-material pursuits. The response concludes by summarizing the argument, acknowledging the opposing view, and reinforcing the main stance.",
    "p73": "<span class=\"orange\">It is incontrovertible that</span> personal achievements can lead to both satisfaction and further desire for success. <span class=\"orange\">The primary impetus for this perspective stems from</span> the fact that accomplishments often provide a sense of fulfillment and boost self-confidence, which can motivate individuals to strive for even greater goals. <span class=\"orange\">Consider, for instance,</span> an athlete who wins a championship may feel a strong sense of satisfaction, but this success might also ignite a desire to win more titles and break records. <span class=\"orange\">Hence,</span> personal achievements can serve as a double-edged sword, bringing both contentment and a renewed hunger for further success.",
    "p74": "For the follow-up question, Template 2 is utilized.

    "h22": "General Scoring Criteria for DET Writing",
    "p5": "Before we dive into the specific topics, let’s take a look at the General Scoring Criteria for writing on the Duolingo English Test. Writing questions fall under the category of open-response question types. In the orange box on the screen, we can see the scoring criteria specifically for writing tasks:",
    "p6": "<strong>Content</strong>: This criterion evaluates the relevance, style, development, and overall effect of your writing on the reader. It’s crucial to stay on topic and ensure that your ideas are well-developed and effectively communicated.",
    "p7": "<strong>Discourse Coherence</strong>: This is about the clarity, cohesion, and logical progression of your ideas. Your response should be organized, with ideas flowing naturally from one to the next, making it easy for the reader to follow.",
    "p8": "<strong>Lexis (Vocabulary)</strong>: Here, the focus is on your use of vocabulary. The test assesses the diversity and sophistication of the words you use, as well as your ability to choose the right words for the context. Proper word formation and spelling also play a significant role in this criterion.",
    "p9": "<strong>Grammar</strong>: This evaluates the complexity and accuracy of your grammatical structures, along with your punctuation. A variety of sentence structures, along with correct grammar, is essential to achieving a high score in this area.",
    "p10": "Each of these aspects contributes to your overall score on the writing section, so it’s important to keep them in mind as you prepare and practice. If you’d like to gain a deeper understanding of the scoring criteria for the DET writing section, please refer to our previous video, which explains the Interactive Writing portion in detail.",

    "figcaption1": "DET Writing Sample UI",
    "p12": "The Writing Sample is an integral part of the Duolingo English Test, where you’ll be required to write an essay based on a given prompt. This task occurs once per test session, giving you the opportunity to demonstrate your ability to construct a coherent, well-structured response.",
    "h24": "Tips for Writing Sample Questions",
    "p13": "Here are some essential tips to keep in mind for the Writing Sample:",
    "p14": "<strong>Write as much as you can: </strong>The more you write, the better you can showcase your ability to develop ideas, use a variety of vocabulary, and demonstrate grammatical complexity. However, quantity should not come at the expense of quality.",
    "p15": "<strong>Ensure spelling and grammatical accuracy: </strong>Mistakes in spelling and grammar can significantly impact your score. Double check your work to ensure it’s as error-free as possible.",
    "p16": "<strong>Pay attention to punctuation: </strong>Proper punctuation is key to clarity and coherence. Misplaced commas or periods can alter the meaning of your sentences and confuse the reader.",
    "p17": "<strong>Ensure your response is relevant to the prompt:</strong> Staying on topic is crucial. Make sure your essay directly addresses the prompt and doesn’t stray into unrelated areas.",

Below, you’ll find examples of these three types of questions:",
    "p21": "<strong>Descriptive Analysis of Objects or Concepts:</strong>",
    "ul4": "<li>Nowadays, customers can shop online and write reviews of the products they have purchased. Describe some of the ways this affects consumers’ decisions.</li><li>Describe some of the ways in which men’s and women’s roles in the home have changed since your parents’ generation.</li>",

    "p24": "As you can see, a question like ‘Describe some of the ways in which men’s and women’s roles in the home have changed since your parents’ generation’ requires us to provide a descriptive analysis. On the other hand, a question such as ‘Describe what you think would happen if you could only buy products made in your country. What would be the most difficult things to live without? How would people’s lives change?’ presents a hypothetical scenario. Lastly, a question like ‘What is the most unusual food that you have ever eaten? Who were you with, and how was the experience? What did you learn about yourself from eating this unusual food?’ asks about personal experiences.",
    "h31": "Personal Experiences &amp; Reflections",
    "p25": "So, how should we approach answering these types of questions? Let’s start by explaining how to answer questions about personal experiences. First, we’ll learn some template sentences for your responses. Here, we’ve provided two sets of template sentences to help you answer descriptive questions about personal experiences.",

    "p72": "Take note of how the transitions and specific phrases connect ideas smoothly, making the argument more persuasive and clear.",
    "p73": "Note that our template sentences sometimes may not fully address all the questions in the prompt. In this case, the question ‘What would be the most difficult things to live without?’ wasn’t completely covered in our previous answer. So, we can address it like this: The most difficult things to live without would likely be the advanced technological gadgets and software that are not produced domestically.",
    "p74": "For instance, if the Windows operating system, which is not domestically produced in my country, were unavailable, it would disrupt the daily operations of countless businesses and individuals who rely on its functionalities.",

    "p83": "     These questions require you to explain a concept, situation, or phenomenon. You should focus on providing a detailed explanation and, if possible, break down your response into clear, logical steps or parts.",
    "ul9": "<li><strong>Policy or Recommendation Questions: </strong></li>",
    "p84": "     Example: “You have been asked to advise a company on whether to contribute funds to the arts or to an organization that promotes environmental protection. What do you recommend? Why? Give specific reasons for your recommendation.”",
    "p85": "     For these types of questions, you are expected to give advice or make a recommendation. Your response should include a clear recommendation and well-reasoned justifications, taking into account the potential consequences of your advice.",

This assessment process reveals <span class=\"red\">[the related\n concept or theme]</span>, cultivating critical judgment and a balanced perspective.”",
    "p155": "You might start by saying, “When evaluating the subject of evaluation, the first criterion that comes to mind is the first key detail, significant for its role in explaining its importance.” This sentence introduces the subject and immediately highlights the first key criterion for evaluation, explaining why it’s important.",
    "p156": "To add depth to your evaluation, you could continue with, “Another factor to weigh is  the second key detail, influencing the evaluation by  describing its impact .” Here, you introduce a second criterion, discussing how it affects the overall evaluation.",

    "p163": "For instance, the sentence “When evaluating the subject of evaluation, the first criterion that comes to mind is the first key detail, significant for its role in explaining its importance ” helps you introduce your evaluation by highlighting the first key factor that you believe is important. This approach provides a structured way to start your evaluation.",
    "p164": "Another useful phrase is “In my opinion, I would choose  one aspect of the evaluated object  over  another aspect of the evaluated object  due to  providing a reason .” This is a straightforward way to express your preference or judgment, especially when comparing two elements.",
    "p165": "Finally, you might use “I think that  one aspect of the evaluated object  is superior in terms of  highlighting an advantage  compared with  another aspect of the evaluated object .” This allows you to clearly state which aspect you find better and why, offering a clear rationale for your opinion.",
    "p166": "By practicing with these templates and expressions, you can effectively structure your responses to evaluative questions, making your arguments both clear and persuasive. Now, take some time to apply these phrases to your own practice, ensuring that you incorporate these elements into your responses to strengthen your evaluations. Here is the sample question:",

    "p173": "Similarly, “I think that one aspect of the evaluated object is superior in terms of  highlighting an advantage compared with another aspect of the evaluated object .” helps to compare different aspects, offering a clear rationale for why you favor one over the other.",
    "p174": "By using these highlighted phrases, you can effectively convey your personal opinion within a structured and well supported argument. This approach not only strengthens your response but also demonstrates your ability to critically evaluate and express nuanced viewpoints.",
    "p175": "We still encourage you to practice writing using this template. You can time yourself as you start the exercise. Alright, welcome back. Let’s look at the following sample answer:",
